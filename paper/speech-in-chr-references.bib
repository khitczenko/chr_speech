	abstract = {This study evaluates whether early vocalizations develop in similar ways in children across diverse cultural contexts. We analyze data from daylong audio recordings of 49 children (1–36 months) from five different language/cultural backgrounds. Citizen scientists annotated these recordings to determine if child vocalizations contained canonical transitions or not (e.g., “ba” vs. “ee”). Results revealed that the proportion of clips reported to contain canonical transitions increased with age. Furthermore, this proportion exceeded 0.15 by around 7 months, replicating and extending previous findings on canonical vocalization development but using data from the natural environments of a culturally and linguistically diverse sample. This work explores how crowdsourcing can be used to annotate corpora, helping establish developmental milestones relevant to multiple languages and cultures. Lower inter-annotator reliability on the crowdsourcing platform, relative to more traditional in-lab expert annotators, means that a larger number of unique annotators and/or annotations are required, and that crowdsourcing may not be a suitable method for more fine-grained annotation decisions. Audio clips used for this project are compiled into a large-scale infant vocalization corpus that is available for other researchers to use in future work.},

Research suggests that emerging speech or language-related disorders might be associated with late onset of canonical babbling. Onset of canonical babbling was investigated for 1,536 high-risk infants, at about 10-months corrected age. Parental report by open-ended questionnaire was found to be an efficient method for ascertaining babbling status. Although delays were infrequent, they were often associated with genetic, neurological, anatomical, and/or physiological abnormalities. Over half the cases of late canonical babbling were not, at the time they were discovered associated with prior significant medical diagnoses. Late canonical-babbling onset may be a predictor of later developmental disabilities, including problems in speech, language, and reading.},

	abstract = {Canonical babbling (CB) is critical in forming foundations for speech. Research has shown that the emergence of CB precedes first words, predicts language outcomes, and is delayed in infants with several communicative disorders. We seek a naturalistic portrayal of CB development, using all-day home recordings to evaluate the influences of age, language, and social circumstances on infant CB production. Thus we address the nature of very early language foundations and how they can be modulated. This is the first study to evaluate possible interactions of language and social circumstance in the development of babbling. We examined the effects of age (6 and 11 months), language/culture (English and Chinese), and social circumstances (during infant-directed speech [IDS], during infant overhearing of adult-directed speech [ADS], or when infants were alone) on canonical babbling ratios (CBR = canonical syllables/total syllables). The results showed a three-way interaction of infant age by infant language/culture by social circumstance. The complexity of the results forces us to recognize that a variety of factors can interact in the development of foundations for language, and that both the infant vocal response to the language/culture environment and the language/culture environment of the infant may change across age.},

Well-formed syllable production is established in the first 10 months of life by hearing infants but not by deaf infants, indicating that audition plays an important role in vocal development. The difference between babbling in the deaf and hearing is apparent if infant vocal sounds are observed from a metaphonological perspective, a view that takes account of the articulatory/acoustic patterns of speech sounds in all mature spoken languages.},

Participants were 16 infants with profound hearing loss and 27 hearing infants who participated at a mean age of 9.9months and/or a mean age of 17.7months. Mean age at cochlear implantation for infants with profound hearing loss was 12.9months, and mean duration of implant use was 4.2months. The data show that before cochlear implantation, repetitive vocalizations were rare. However, 4months after cochlear implant activation, infants with hearing loss produced both repetitive vocalizations and repetitions per vocalization at levels commensurate with their hearing peers. The results support the hypothesis that repetition emerges as a means of vocal exploration during the time when hearing infants (and infants with cochlear implants) form auditory–motor representations and neural connections between cortical areas active in syllable production and syllable perception, during the transition from nonlinguistic to linguistic vocalization.},

The Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA™) system allows researchers and clinicians to collect daylong recordings and obtain automated measures to characterize a child’s language environment. This meta-analysis evaluates the predictability of LENA’s automated measures for language skills in young children. We systematically searched reports for associations between LENA’s automated measures, specifically, adult word count (AWC), conversational turn count (CTC), and child vocalization count (CVC), and language skills in children younger than 48 months. Using robust variance estimation, we calculated weighted mean effect sizes and conducted moderator analyses exploring the factors that might affect this relationship. The results revealed an overall medium effect size for the correlation between LENA’s automated measures and language skills. This relationship was largely consistent regardless of child developmental status, publication status, language assessment modality and method, or the age at which the LENA recording was taken; however, the effect was moderated by the gap between LENA recordings and language measures taken. Among the three measures, there were medium associations between CTC and CVC and language, whereas there was a small-to-medium association between AWC and language. These findings extend beyond validation work conducted by the LENA Research Foundation and suggest certain predictive strength of LENA’s automated measures for child language. We discussed possible mechanisms underlying the observed associations, as well as the theoretical, methodological, and clinical implications of these findings.},

Recent studies indicate that late onset of canonical babbling may be a predictor of disorders. A simple screening procedure that focuses on canonical babbling was used to evaluate over 3400 infants at risk who were about 10 months of age. Among infants who showed late onset of canonical babbling, fewer than half had been previously diagnosed as having a significant medical problem that might have accounted for the delay. A follow-up study indicated that infants with delayed canonical babbling had smaller production vocabularies at 18, 24, and 30 months than did infants in the control group. The results suggest that late onset of canonical babbling, a factor that can be monitored effectively through an interview with a parent, can predict delay in the onset of speech production.},

Further, even though low SES infants produce well-formed speech-like structures on sched-ule, they show a reliably lower tendency to vocalize in general, as reflected by fewer utterances per minute in recorded samples.},

Results show that in spite of gross phonetic differences between the adult phonologies of Spanish and English, babies from both groups produce predominantly CV syllables with voiceless, unaspirated plosive consonants.

reduce infant volubility.},

              We examined associations between vocal communication with canonical syllables and expressive language and then examined 2 potential alternative explanations for such associations.
            
            
              Method
              
                Specifically, we tested whether the associations remained when excluding canonical syllables in identifiable words and controlling for the number of communication acts. Participants included 68 preverbal or low verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (

                = 35.26 months).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Vocal communication with canonical syllables and expressive language were concurrently and longitudinally associated with moderate to strong (

                p
                s {\textless} .001) effect sizes. Even when excluding spoken words from the vocal predictor and controlling for the number of communication acts, vocal communication with canonical syllables predicted expressive language.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The findings provide increased support for measuring vocal communication with canonical syllables and for examining a causal relation between vocal communication with canonical syllables and expressive language in children with ASD who are preverbal or low verbal. In future studies, it may be unnecessary to eliminate identifiable words when measuring vocal communication in this population. Following replication, vocal communication with canonical syllables may be considered when making intervention- planning decisions.},

The recordings were analyzed using experimentally blinded human coding as well as LENA automated analysis.ParticipantsTen infants with CP (± cleft lip) and 10 age-matched infants without CP.Main Outcome MeasuresSeveral measurements were obtained from the LENA automated analysis software. In addition, human coded measurements of vocalization and language environment, including the true canonical babbling ratio and the infant-directed speech ratio, were analyzed for each time point of data collection for each infant. Statistical analyses were performed to conduct group and age comparisons for each measure of vocalization and language environment.ResultsNo group differences emerged in number of syllables produced. Infants with CP exhibited late onset and fewer productions of canonical syllables compared to infants without CP. Infants with CP did not show significant differences from infants without CP in measures related to language environment across ages.ConclusionThis study provides detailed information through naturalistic all-day home recordings about vocal development and early language environments in infants with CP before and after palatal repair.

Recent studies have revealed, however, that adult song is not always stable, extending our understanding of the mechanisms involved in song maintenance, and their similarity to those active during song learning. Here we review some of the processes that contribute to song learning and production, with an emphasis on the role of auditory feedback. We then consider some of the possible neural substrates involved in these processes, particularly basal ganglia circuitry. Although a thorough treatment of human speech is beyond the scope of this article, we point out similarities between speech and song learning, and ways in which studies of these disparate behaviours complement each other in developing an understanding of general principles that contribute to learning and maintenance of vocal behaviour.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Recording young children's vocalizations through wearables is a promising method to assess language development. However, accurately and rapidly annotating these files remains challenging. Online crowdsourcing with the collaboration of citizen scientists could be a feasible solution. In this article, we assess the extent to which citizen scientists' annotations align with those gathered in the lab for recordings collected from young children.
            
            
              Method
              Segments identified by Language ENvironment Analysis as produced by the key child were extracted from one daylong recording for each of 20 participants: 10 low-risk control children and 10 children diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, a neurogenetic syndrome characterized by severe language impairments. Speech samples were annotated by trained annotators in the laboratory as well as by citizen scientists on Zooniverse. All annotators assigned one of five labels to each sample: Canonical, Noncanonical, Crying, Laughing, and Junk. This allowed the derivation of two child-level vocalization metrics: the Linguistic Proportion and the Canonical Proportion.
            
            
              Results
              At the segment level, Zooniverse classifications had moderate precision and recall. More importantly, the Linguistic Proportion and the Canonical Proportion derived from Zooniverse annotations were highly correlated with those derived from laboratory annotations.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Annotations obtained through a citizen science platform can help us overcome challenges posed by the process of annotating daylong speech recordings. Particularly when used in composites or derived metrics, such annotations can be used to investigate early markers of language delays.},

The study provides the indication that at-risk infants are not generally delayed in the ability to produce well-formed speech-like sounds as indicated in tape-recorded vocal samples. At the same time, premature infants show a tendency to produce well-formed syllables less consistently than full terms after the point at which parents and laboratory personnel note the onset of the canonical babbling stage (the point after which well-formed syllables are well established in the infant vocal repertoires). Further, even though low SES infants produce well-formed speech-like structures on schedule, they show a reliably lower tendency to vocalize in general, as reflected by fewer utterances per minute in recorded samples.},

A role for infant vocalizations produced endogenously, potentially providing raw material for interaction and a basis for growth in the vocal capacity itself, has received less attention. We report that in laboratory recordings of infants and their parents, the bulk of infant speech-like vocalizations, or “protophones”, were directed toward no one and instead appeared to be generated endogenously, mostly in exploration of vocal abilities. The tendency to predominantly produce protophones without directing them to others occurred both during periods when parents were instructed to interact with their infants and during periods when parents were occupied with an interviewer, with the infants in the room. The results emphasize the infant as an agent in vocal learning, even when not interacting socially and suggest an enhanced perspective on foundations for vocal language.},

In this paper, we consider the problem as a developmental robotics one, in which an agent actively learns sensorimotor mappings of an articulatory vocal model. More speciﬁcally, we show how intrinsic motivations can allow the emergence of efﬁcient exploration strategies, driving the way a learning agent will interact with its environment to collect an adequate learning set.},

            We investigated the hypothesis that infants search in an acoustic space for vocalisations that elicit adult utterances and vice versa, inspired by research on animal and human foraging. Infant-worn recorders were used to collect day-long audio recordings, and infant speech-related and adult vocalisation onsets and offsets were automatically identified. We examined vocalisation-to-vocalisation steps, focusing on inter-vocalisation time intervals and distances in an acoustic space defined by mean pitch and mean amplitude, measured from the child’s perspective. Infant inter-vocalisation intervals were shorter immediately following a vocal response from an adult. Adult intervals were shorter following an infant response and adult inter-vocalisation pitch differences were smaller following the receipt of a vocal response from the infant. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that infants and caregivers are foraging vocally for social input. Increasing infant age was associated with changes in inter-vocalisation step sizes for both infants and adults, and we found associations between response likelihood and acoustic characteristics. Future work is needed to determine the impact of different labelling methods and of automatic labelling errors on the results. The study represents a novel application of foraging theory, demonstrating how infant behaviour and infant-caregiver interaction can be characterised as foraging processes.},

Schizophrenia with many negative symptoms was associated with poor premorbid functioning, insidious onset, partial or no remissions during the first several years of illness, and in most cases a progressive course leading to permanent disability. Schizophrenia with few negative symptoms was associated with good premorbid functioning, acute onset, intermittent early course, and a better prognosis. Positive symptoms predicted future hospitalizations but were less powerful and specific as indicators of differential illness history, course, and long-term functional incapacity. As predictors of long-term outcome, negative symptoms were of greater value measured at index admission several years after illness onset than at first hospital admission. Multivariate analyses indicated that two negative symptoms (anhedonia and affective flattening) contribute significantly to outcome variance independent of their association with premorbid functioning or positive symptoms. Patients with the poorest long-term outcome tended to show an increase in negative symptoms during the early years of their illness. Progressive negative symptoms early in the course of schizophrenia may thus reflect or signal a process leading to long-term functional disability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the present study, written narratives from 84 individuals (UHR=41, control=43) were examined. Referential cohesion variables and relationships with symptoms and relevant cognitive variables were also investigated. Findings reveal less word “stem” overlap in narratives produced by UHR youth compared to controls, and correlations with symptom domains and verbal learning. The present study highlights the potential usefulness of automated analysis of written narratives in identifying at-risk youth and these data provide critical information in better understanding the etiology of psychosis. As writing production is commonly elicited in educational contexts, markers of aberrant cohesion in writing represent significant potential for identifying youth who could benefit from further screening, and utilizing software that is easily accessible and free may provide utility in academic and clinical settings.},

Previous studies have identified distinctive linguistic patterns displayed by those experiencing a wide range of physical or mental health difficulties, especially in terms of increased use of first-person singular pronouns and negative words. We used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC) in comparing the linguistic content of individuals in online communities for different types of mental distress (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Schizophrenia) and controls (a finance discussion forum). Compared to the control group, people who experience any form of distress displayed a higher frequency of singular personal pronouns and higher frequency of negative emotion word use. Those who participated in schizophrenia discussion forums had the highest use of third person plural pronouns (e.g., they, them), which could reflect persecutory ideas associated with the diagnosis. Borderline Personality Disorder discussion forums had the highest incidence of using third person singular pronouns (e.g., he, hers), which could be due to excessive focus on significant others, possibly because of insecure attachment patterns. Findings highlight important similarities between those identifying with different forms of mental distress.},

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Emotional states, attitudes and intentions are often conveyed by modulations in the tone of voice. Impaired recognition of emotions from a tone of voice (receptive prosody) has been described as characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the ability to express non-verbal information in speech (expressive prosody) has been understudied. This paper describes a useful technique for quantifying the degree of expressive prosody deﬁcits in schizophrenia, using a semi-automatic method, and evaluates this method’s ability to discriminate between patient and control groups. Forty-ﬁve medicated patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were matched with thirty-ﬁve healthy comparison subjects. Production of expressive prosodic speech was analyzed using variation in fundamental frequency (F0) measures on an emotionally neutral reading task. Results revealed that patients with schizophrenia exhibited signiﬁcantly more pauses (p {\textless} .001), were slower (p {\textless} .001), and showed less pitch variability in speech (p {\textless} .05) and fewer variations in syllable timing (p {\textless} .001) than control subjects. These features have been associated with «ﬂat» speech prosody. Signal processing algorithms applied to speech were shown to be capable of discriminating between patients and controls with an accuracy of 93.8\%. These speech parameters may have a diagnostic and prognosis value and therefore could be used as a dependent measure in clinical trials.},

They are often associated with core negative symptoms such as flat affect and alogia, and with the social impairments seen in the disorder. This suggests that voice atypicalities may represent a marker of clinical features and social functioning in schizophrenia. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence for distinctive acoustic patterns in schizophrenia, as well as their relation to clinical features. We identified 46 articles, including 55 studies with a total of 1254 patients with schizophrenia and 699 healthy controls. Summary effect sizes (Hedges'g and Pearson's r) estimates were calculated using multilevel Bayesian modeling. We identified weak atypicalities in pitch variability (g = −0.55) related to flat affect, and stronger atypicalities in proportion of spoken time, speech rate, and pauses (g's between −0.75 and −1.89) related to alogia and flat affect. However, the effects were mostly modest (with the important exception of pause duration) compared to perceptual and clinical judgments, and characterized by large heterogeneity between studies. Moderator analyses revealed that tasks with a more demanding cognitive and social component showed larger effects both in contrasting patients and controls and in assessing symptomatology. In conclusion, studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but, yet unsystematic avenue for establishing markers of schizophrenia. We outline recommendations towards more cumulative, open, and theory-driven research.},

A classifier based on linear discriminant analysis was employed to differentiate between controls and schizophrenic subjects. Processing the recordings with the algorithm developed demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate schizophrenic patients and controls with a classification accuracy of 79.4\% (specificity=83.6\%, sensitivity=75.2\%) based on speech pause related parameters extracted from recordings carried out in standard office (non-studio) environments.

	abstract = {Objective
Individuals with autism and schizophrenia exhibit atypical language and social symptoms. The extent to which these symptoms are evident during development and in current functioning is unclear.
Method
Three groups of patients aged 11–20 diagnosed as clinical-high-risk for psychosis (CHR; n=15), first episode psychosis (FEP; n=16), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n=20), plus typically developing individuals (TYP; n=20) were compared on common autism parent-report questionnaires assessing social and language development and current functioning including the Social Communication Questionnaire, the Children's Communication Checklist, and the Social Reciprocity Scale.
Results
All clinical groups demonstrated atypical social and language development, with social impairment highest in ASD. Twenty percent of participants with CHR and FEP met diagnostic criteria for ASD as assessed by parent-report. ASD exhibited greater current syntactic, and pragmatic language symptoms including delayed echolalia, pedantic speech, and deficits in appreciating irony and sarcasm. All clinical groups exhibited current deficits in social functioning. CHR and FE had similar and intermediate levels of functioning relative to ASD and TYP, with CHR generally scoring closer to TYP, providing construct validity for the CHR diagnostic label.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that ASDs, CHR, and FEP share common features of atypical neurodevelopment of language and social function. Evidence of impaired social reciprocity across both disorders and distinct language symptoms in ASDs provides important information for differential diagnosis and psychosis prevention, as well as leads for future investigations of comparative genetics and pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Since initial conceptualizations, schizophrenia has been thought to involve core disturbances in the ability to form complex, integrated ideas. Although this has been studied in terms of formal thought disorder, the level of involvement of altered latent semantic structure is less clear. To explore this question, we compared the personal narratives of adults with schizophrenia (n=200) to those produced by an HIV+ sample (n=55) using selected indices from Coh-Metrix. Coh-Metrix is a software system designed to compute various language usage statistics from transcribed written and spoken language documents. It differs from many other frequency-based systems in that Coh-Metrix measures a wide range of language processes, ranging from basic descriptors (e.g., total words) to indices assessing more sophisticated processes within sentences, between sentences, and across paragraphs (e.g., deep cohesion). Consistent with predictions, the narratives in schizophrenia exhibited less cohesion even after controlling for age and education. Specifically, the schizophrenia group spoke fewer words, demonstrated less connection between ideas and clauses, provided fewer causal/intentional markers, and displayed lower levels of deep cohesion. A classification model using only Coh-Metrix indices found language markers correctly classified participants in nearly three-fourths of cases. These findings suggest a particular pattern of difficulties cohesively connecting thoughts about oneself and the world results in a perceived lack of coherence in schizophrenia. These results are consistent with Bleuler's model of schizophrenia and offer a novel way to understand and measure alterations in thought and speech over time.},

	abstract = {The traditional view that the basal ganglia and cerebellum are simply involved in the control of movement has been challenged in recent years. One of the pivotal reasons for this reappraisal has been new information about basal ganglia and cerebellar connections with the cerebral cortex. In essence, recent anatomical studies have revealed that these connections are organized into discrete circuits or `loops'. Rather than serving as a means for widespread cortical areas to gain access to the motor system, these loops reciprocally interconnect a large and diverse set of cerebral cortical areas with the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The properties of neurons within the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of these circuits resembles the properties of neurons within the cortical areas subserved by these loops. For example, neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with motor areas of the cerebral cortex is highly correlated with parameters of movement, while neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with areas of the prefrontal cortex is more related to aspects of cognitive function. Thus, individual loops appear to be involved in distinct behavioral functions. Studies of basal ganglia and cerebellar pathology support this conclusion. Damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of circuits with motor areas of cortex leads to motor symptoms, whereas damage of the subcortical components of circuits with non-motor areas of cortex causes higher-order deficits. In this report, we review some of the new anatomical, physiological and behavioral findings that have contributed to a reappraisal of function concerning the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with the cerebral cortex.},

Several studies have shown that some manifestations of schizophrenia (e.g., the negative symptoms that include blunting of speech prosody, as well as the disorganization symptoms that lead to disordered language) can be understood from the perspective of linguistics. However, schizophrenia research has not kept pace with technologies in computational linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. As such, we examine the writings of schizophrenia patients analyzing their syntax, semantics and pragmatics. In addition, we analyze tweets of (self pro-claimed) schizophrenia patients who publicly discuss their diagnoses. For writing samples dataset, syntactic features are found to be the most successful in classification whereas for the less structured Twitter dataset, a combination of features performed the best.},

They typically make use of a large feature set to train a classifier for distinguishing between two groups of interest, i.e. a clinical and control group. However, a purely data-driven approach runs the risk of overfitting to a particular data set, especially when sample sizes are limited. Here, we first down-select the set of language features to a small subset that is related to a well-validated test of functional ability, the Social Skills Performance Assessment (SSPA). This helps establish the concurrent validity of the selected features. We use only these features to train a simple classifier to distinguish between groups of interest. Linear regression reveals that a subset of language features can effectively model the SSPA, with a correlation coefficient of 0.75. Furthermore, the same feature set can be used to build a strong binary classifier to distinguish between healthy controls and a clinical group (AUC = 0.96) and also between patients within the clinical group with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (AUC = 0.83).},

From each speech sample, a file of F0 (pitch) and formant values (F1 and F2, resonance bands indicating the moment-by-moment shape of the oral cavity), and the portion of the recording in which there was speaking (“fraction voiced,” FV), was created. Correlations between variability in the phonetic indices and negative symptom severity were tested and further examined using regression analyses. Meaningful negative correlations between Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) total score and standard deviation (SD) of F2, as well as variability in pitch (SD F0) were observed in the Italian sample. We also found meaningful associations of SANS affective flattening and SANS alogia with SD F0, and of SANS avolition/apathy and SD F2 in the Italian sample. In both samples, FV was meaningfully correlated with SANS total score, avolition/apathy, and anhedonia/asociality.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a mental disorder which afflicts an estimated 0.7\% of adults world wide. It affects many areas of mental function, often evident from incoherent speech. Diagnosing schizophrenia relies on subjective judgments resulting in disagreements even among trained clinicians. Recent studies have proposed the use of natural language processing for diagnosis by drawing on automatically-extracted linguistic features like discourse coherence and lexicon. Here, we present the first benchmark comparison of previously proposed coherence models for detecting symptoms of schizophrenia and evaluate their performance on a new dataset of recorded interviews between subjects and clinicians. We also present two alternative coherence metrics based on modern sentence embedding techniques that outperform the previous methods on our dataset. Lastly, we propose a novel computational model for reference incoherence based on ambiguous pronoun usage and show that it is a highly predictive feature on our data. While the number of subjects is limited in this pilot study, our results suggest new directions for diagnosing common symptoms of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {We introduce an architecture, the Tensor Product Recurrent Network (TPRN). In our application of TPRN, internal representations—learned by end-to-end optimization in a deep neural network performing a textual question-answering (QA) task—can be interpreted using basic concepts from linguistic theory. No performance penalty need be paid for this increased interpretability: the proposed model performs comparably to a state-of-the-art system on the SQuAD QA task. The internal representation which is interpreted is a Tensor Product Representation: for each input word, the model selects a symbol to encode the word, and a role in which to place the symbol, and binds the two together. The selection is via soft attention. The overall interpretation is built from interpretations of the symbols, as recruited by the trained model, and interpretations of the roles as used by the model. We ﬁnd support for our initial hypothesis that symbols can be interpreted as lexical-semantic word meanings, while roles can be interpreted as approximations of grammatical roles (or categories) such as subject, wh-word, determiner, etc. Fine-grained analysis reveals speciﬁc correspondences between the learned roles and parts of speech as assigned by a standard tagger (Toutanova et al. 2003), and ﬁnds several discrepancies in the model’s favor. In this sense, the model learns signiﬁcant aspects of grammar, after having been exposed solely to linguistically unannotated text, questions, and answers: no prior linguistic knowledge is given to the model. What is given is the means to build representations using symbols and roles, with an inductive bias favoring use of these in an approximately discrete manner.},

The theoretical basis rests on the distinction between the two basic clinical syndromes of schizophrenia: the positive and the negative. The underlying assumption  according to the holistic model of the human being  was that the particular clinical syndromes typical of schizophrenia are reflected in the language and, analogous to the positive and negative syndromes of clinical schizophrenia, in the positive and negative syndromes of language disorder. Such an approach tries to reconcile the clinical and the linguistic points of view which, in the relevant literature, are most often described as separate paradigms, and to show that the human being is an entity, hence one cannot analyze linguistic processes independently of other psychic processes, including the disease processes.},

While it is difﬁcult for humans to quantify speech behaviors precisely, acoustic descriptors, such as tenseness of voice and speech rate, can be quantiﬁed automatically. In this work, we identify previously unstudied acoustic descriptors related to the severity of psychotic symptoms within a clinical population (N=29). Our dataset consists of semi-structured interviews between patients and clinicians. Psychotic disorders are often characterized by two groups of symptoms: negative and positive. While negative symptoms are also prevalent in disorders such as depression, positive symptoms in psychotic disorders have rarely been studied from an acoustic and computational perspective. Our experiments show relationships between psychotic symptoms and acoustic descriptors related to voice quality consistency, variation of speech rate and volume, vowel space, and a parameter of glottal ﬂow. Further, we show that certain acoustic descriptors can track a patient’s state from admission to discharge. Finally, we demonstrate that measures from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) can be estimated with acoustic descriptors.},

Identifying and detecting signs of SZ is difficult given that SZ is relatively uncommon, affecting approximately 1\% of the US population, and people suffering with SZ often believe that they do not have the disorder. Linguistic abnormalities are a hallmark of SZ and many of the illness's symptoms are manifested through language. In this paper we leverage the vast amount of data available from social media and use statistical and machine learning approaches to study linguistic characteristics of SZ. We collected and analyzed a large corpus of Reddit posts from users claiming to have received a formal diagnosis of SZ and identified several linguistic features that differentiated these users from a control (CTL) group. We compared these results to other findings on social media linguistic analysis and SZ. We also developed a machine learning classifier to automatically identify self-identified users with SZ on Reddit.},

Symptoms include hallucinations, confused and disturbed thoughts or lack of self-awareness. Recent studies have found that psychotic patients can be objectively screened using graph-theoretical algorithms for speech analysis. This analysis often relies in manually executed tasks such as syntagma generation, text splitting or manual feature selection for classification. To solve this fundamental limitation, we use three fully-automated text analysis tools graph generation methods. In addition, since aspects of psychosis may be manifested in semantic aspects of speech, we also developed a semantic features index based on speech coherence. We show that using this combined approach, classifications obtained from automatic techniques are higher than 85 \% in a database of 20 schizophrenic patients, with similar results to previous works. In summary, here we develop and validate a new tool for automated speech processing which includes semantic and structural aspects. The tool performs similar to manual screening procedures providing a new method to complement standard psychometric scales and fostering automated psychiatric diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Background: Measures of articulatory diadochokinesis (DDK) are widely used in the assessment of motor speech disorders and they play a role in detecting abnormality, monitoring speech performance changes and classifying syndromes. Although in clinical practice DDK is generally measured perceptually, without support from instrumental methods that display the acoustic waveform, no standard measurement procedures are employed and studies on inter- and intra-rater reliability are lacking. Aims: To investigate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of perceptual DDK measurement and the possible impact of experience on rating performance.
Methods \& Procedures: Ten speech and language therapists and ten untrained controls rated 12 DDK speech samples, including two pairs of identical samples, of speakers with different neurological speech disorders. We compared timing for repetitions as close as possible to 5 s, for 5 s exactly, and for as long as the speaker could manage; as well as four qualitative features (rhythm, distinctness, loudness and overall impression). Counts by time were compared with objective outcomes from sound spectrograms. Outcomes \& Results: Inter- and intra-rater reliability was lower than should be acceptable for clinical diagnostic and outcome assessment. The most accurate and repeatable procedure (compared with objective measurement) was counting the syllables within the first 5 s. There was no unequivocal influence of clinical experience on accuracy.
Conclusions: The findings suggest caution in employing and interpreting clinical DDK measures as diagnostic and outcome measures. More research is necessary to settle the influence of experience on time and count accuracy and what modifications to timing might bring increased agreement that permits DDK to realize its full potential in assessment.},

	abstract = {Word embeddings are a powerful machine-learning framework that represents each English word by a vector. The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

	abstract = {Machines learn what people know implicitly
AlphaGo has demonstrated that a machine can learn how to do things that people spend many years of concentrated study learning, and it can rapidly learn how to do them better than any human can. Caliskan et al. now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs—for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.
Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133
Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.
Computers can learn which words go together more or less often and can thus mimic human performance on a test of implicit bias.

	abstract = {Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems, which use sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to convert spoken language to text, have become increasingly widespread, powering popular virtual assistants, facilitating automated closed captioning, and enabling digital dictation platforms for health care. Over the last several years, the quality of these systems has dramatically improved, due both to advances in deep learning and to the collection of large-scale datasets used to train the systems. There is concern, however, that these tools do not work equally well for all subgroups of the population. Here, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art ASR systems—developed by Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft—to transcribe structured interviews conducted with 42 white speakers and 73 black speakers. In total, this corpus spans five US cities and consists of 19.8 h of audio matched on the age and gender of the speaker. We found that all five ASR systems exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers. We trace these disparities to the underlying acoustic models used by the ASR systems as the race gap was equally large on a subset of identical phrases spoken by black and white individuals in our corpus. We conclude by proposing strategies—such as using more diverse training datasets that include African American Vernacular English—to reduce these performance differences and ensure speech recognition technology is inclusive.},

	abstract = {Objective
Given the fundamental role of thought disorder in schizophrenia, subtle communication disturbance may be a valuable predictor of subsequent development of psychosis. Here we examined the contribution of thought and communication disturbance to the prediction of outcome in adolescents identified as putatively prodromal for psychosis.
Method
Transcribed speech samples were elicited from 105 adolescents (54 identified as being at clinical high risk for a first episode of psychosis [CHR], and 51 demographically comparable comparison subjects) and coded for formal thought disorder (FTD) and linguistic cohesion. We then examined the association of baseline FTD/cohesion with conversion to psychosis and social and role outcome at follow-up, approximately 1 year later.
Results
At baseline, CHR patients who subsequently converted to psychosis (CHR+) showed an elevated rate of illogical thinking and poverty of content (POC) in their speech, relative to both typically developing controls and CHR patients who did not convert to psychosis (CHR−). CHR+ youth also used significantly less referential cohesion at baseline, indicating that they provide fewer references to persons, objects, or events mentioned in preceding utterances. Multiple regression models indicated that, among measures of FTD/cohesion, illogical thinking was uniquely predictive of subsequent conversion to psychosis, whereas POC and referential cohesion were significant predictors of social and role functioning, respectively.
Conclusions
Despite the absence of fully psychotic symptoms, putatively prodromal individuals evidence signs of communication disturbance that are qualitatively similar to those seen in schizophrenia and are predictive of both conversion to psychosis and psychosocial outcome. These findings suggest that FTD measures have prognostic significance for at-risk youth.},

	abstract = {Background
Prior studies have implicated baseline positive and negative symptoms as predictors of psychosis onset among individuals at clinical high risk (CHR), but none have evaluated latent trajectories of symptoms over time. This study evaluated the dynamic evolution of symptoms leading to psychosis onset in a CHR cohort.
Method
100 CHR participants were assessed quarterly for up to 2.5years. Latent trajectory analysis was used to identify patterns of symptom change. Logistic and proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the predictive value for psychosis onset of baseline symptoms and symptom trajectories.
Results
Transition rate to psychosis was 26\%. Disorganized communication (i.e., subthreshold thought disorder) presented an increased hazard for psychosis onset, both at baseline (Hazard Ratio (95\% CI)=1.4 (1.1–1.9)) and as a trajectory of high persistent disorganized communication (Hazard Ratio (95\% CI)=2.2 (1.0–4.9)). Interval clinical data did not improve the predictive value of baseline symptoms for psychosis onset.
Conclusions
High baseline disorganized communication evident at ascertainment tended to persist and lead to psychosis onset, consistent with prior behavioral and speech analysis studies in similar cohorts. Remediation of language dysfunction therefore may be a candidate strategy for preventive intervention.},

	abstract = {Objective
This research addresses the relationship of formal thought disorder in the early stages of psychotic illness to the long-term outcome of mental health many years later. The specific topic of concern was to evaluate the prognostic significance of thought disorder on the severity of psychosis over time.
Methods
Subjects with new-onset psychosis were evaluated on a variety of measures including education, physical health, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. They were also given the Thought, Language, and Communication Scale to evaluate thought disorder. Subjects were interviewed again at 10 and 20 years to evaluate variations in outcome. Appropriate statistical methods were used to evaluate changes in the level of functioning over time.
Results
Thought disorder was not unique to schizophrenia. Bipolar patients presented with significant positive thought disorder at the onset of psychosis. Overtime positive thought disorder gradually improved in most patients. Negative thought disorder was more persistent, especially in subjects with schizophrenia. Initial psychosis with thought disorder characterized by poverty of content seemed to be associated with poor long-term outcome.
Conclusion
Formal thought disorder can predict outcome in some cases of psychosis. Not all types of thought disorder have the same prognostic implication. Positive forms of thought disorder (pressured speech, tangentiality) had no significant predictive value. Negative thought disorder (particularly poverty of speech and poverty of content) tend to predict a chronic, more unrelenting course of illness.},

Positive thought disorder was more prominent at the acute phase in schizophrenic and manic patients than in other types of psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders. At followup, positive thought disorder did not persist for all schizophrenics, but a significantly larger percentage of schizophrenic than other psychotic and nonpsychotic patients followed a course in which positive thought disorder was either persistently or episodically present. Positive thought disorder, when seen after the acute phase, was related to concurrent functioning, and predicted subsequent poorer outcome and functioning for both schizophrenic and nonschizophrenic patients. Positive thought disorder was one of several central features of the active schizophrenic disorder. Among schizophrenics, it was related to other major types of psychopathology, especially delusions, another positive symptom with cognirive-ideational elements. Severe positive thought disorder after the acute phase indicated a sustained episode, and suggested a more severe type of schizophrenia with a poorer prognosis.},

	abstract = {Objective
This research addresses the relationship of formal thought disorder in the early stages of psychotic illness to the long-term outcome of mental health many years later. The specific topic of concern was to evaluate the prognostic significance of thought disorder on the severity of psychosis over time.
Methods
Subjects with new-onset psychosis were evaluated on a variety of measures including education, physical health, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. They were also given the Thought, Language, and Communication Scale to evaluate thought disorder. Subjects were interviewed again at 10 and 20 years to evaluate variations in outcome. Appropriate statistical methods were used to evaluate changes in the level of functioning over time.
Results
Thought disorder was not unique to schizophrenia. Bipolar patients presented with significant positive thought disorder at the onset of psychosis. Overtime positive thought disorder gradually improved in most patients. Negative thought disorder was more persistent, especially in subjects with schizophrenia. Initial psychosis with thought disorder characterized by poverty of content seemed to be associated with poor long-term outcome.
Conclusion
Formal thought disorder can predict outcome in some cases of psychosis. Not all types of thought disorder have the same prognostic implication. Positive forms of thought disorder (pressured speech, tangentiality) had no significant predictive value. Negative thought disorder (particularly poverty of speech and poverty of content) tend to predict a chronic, more unrelenting course of illness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formal thought disorder is a core symptom of schizophrenia. It is associated with a reversed lateralization of the superior temporal cortex volume, an area that is implicated in lexical retrieval. We investigated the neural correlates of word retrieval during continuous speech in patients with formal thought disorder using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
METHODS: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast was measured with fMRI while six patients with schizophrenia and six healthy control subjects spoke about seven Rorschach inkblots for 3 min each. Subjects produced varying amounts of speech during each run. In a within subject design, the number of words produced was correlated with the BOLD contrast in the two runs in each participant who showed the highest variance of speech output.
RESULTS: In control subjects, the amount of speech produced was mainly correlated with activation in the left superior temporal gyrus. In the patient group, the main correlations were in the right superior temporal gyrus.
CONCLUSIONS: During the production of continuous speech, patients with formal thought disorder showed a reversed laterality of activation in the superior temporal cortex. This is consistent with findings of perturbed hemispheric interaction in schizophrenia, particularly in patients with formal thought disorder.},

	abstract = {Thought disorder is a fundamental symptom of schizophrenia, observable as irregularities in speech. It has been associated with functional and structural abnormalities in brain regions involved in language processing, including left temporal regions, during language production tasks. We were interested in the neural correlates of thought disorder during receptive language processing, as this function is relatively preserved despite relying on the same brain regions as expressive language. Twelve patients with schizophrenia and 11 controls listened to 30-s speech samples while undergoing fMRI scanning. Thought disorder and global symptom ratings were obtained for each patient. Thought disorder but not global symptomatology correlated positively with the BOLD response in the left posterior superior temporal lobe while listening to comprehensible speech (cluster-level corrected p=.023). The pattern of brain activity associated with thought disorder during listening to comprehensible speech differs from that seen during language generation tasks, where a reduction of the leftward laterality of language has often been observed. As receptive language is spared in thought disorder, we propose that the increase in activation reflects compensatory processing allowing for normal performance.},

Six right-handed male patients with prominent ‘positive’ FTD were compared with six schizophrenic patients without FTD and seven volunteers, matched for cognitive and demographic variables. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (IMRI) was used to measure cerebral activation while subjects read and completed sentence stems out loud. During a GENERATION condition, subjects were required to generate a word which completed the sentence stem appropriately. During a DECISION condition, subjects selected and articulated one of two presented terminal words. A READING condition served as baseline. The three conditions were compared with each other. Regions activated were identified in each group, and between-group differences were detected using an ANCOVA. When GENERATION was compared with READING, FTD patients showed less activation in the right superior temporal gyrus than patients without FTD or controls, but greater activation in the left inferior frontal, inferior temporal and fusiform gyri. FTD patients also showed an attenuated right temporal response when GENERATION was compared with DECISION. This differential engagement of the right temporal cortex was independent of differences in the speed or accuracy of responses, whereas the left fronto–temporal differences in activation were not evident after covarying for task errors. The attenuated engagement of right temporal cortex, which is implicated in language comprehension at the discourse level, is consistent with neuropsychological evidence linking thought disorder with deficits in processing linguistic context.},

	abstract = {Objective:Few studies have explored in detail the relation of cognitive deficits in attention, working memory, and semantics to thought disorder. The authors sought to determine whether thought disorder resides in the semantic system or elsewhere. Method:Twenty-three normal comparison subjects and 23 patients with schizophrenia participated in the study. All subjects received tests of executive function and working memory, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Letter-Number Span test; a test of deployment of attentional resources; and tests of semantic processing and language comprehension, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Speed and Capacity of Language-Processing Test, the Boston Naming Test, and tests of semantic verbal fluency and phonologic verbal fluency, from which was derived a difference score. All patients were also administered the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language, and Communication to assess thought disorder. Results:The normal subjects were compared with the schizophrenic patients who were rated as having mild thought disorder (N=13) or moderate to severe thought disorder (N=10). While differences between the schizophrenic subgroups and the comparison subjects were observed on nearly all tests, a large difference in effect size between the two schizophrenic subgroups was apparent only in the verbal fluency difference score. In a series of multiple regression analyses, two variables made significant contributions to the prediction of positive thought disorder: the verbal fluency difference score and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score. Conclusions:These results suggest that clinically rated thought disorder is associated with and may result from semantic processing abnormalities. In particular, patients with more severe thought disorder may have difficulty accessing semantic items because of disorganization of the semantic systems and, to a more limited degree, may also lack a semantic or conceptual knowledge base.

	abstract = {Background. Previous studies on semantic priming have suggested that schizophrenic patients with language disturbances demonstrate enhanced semantic and indirect semantic priming eﬀects relative to controls. However, the interpretation of semantic priming studies in schizophrenic patients is obscured by methological problems and several artefacts (such as length of illness). We, therefore, used a psychometric high-risk approach to test whether healthy subjects reporting language disturbances resembling those of schizophrenics (as measured by the Frankfurt Complaint Questionnaire subscale ‘ language ’) display increased priming eﬀects. In addition, the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire was used to cover symptoms of schizotypal personality. Enhanced priming was expected to occur under conditions favouring automatic processes.
Methods. One hundred and sixty healthy subjects performed a lexical decision semantic priming task containing two diﬀerent stimulus onset asynchronicities (200 ms and 700 ms) with two experimental conditions (semantic priming and indirect semantic priming) each.
Results. Analyses of variance revealed that the Frankfurt Complaint Questionnaire-‘ language ’ high scorers signiﬁcantly diﬀered from low scorers in three of the four priming conditions indicating increased automatic spreading activation. No signiﬁcant results were obtained for the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire total and subscales scores.
Conclusions. In line with Maher and Spitzer it is suggested that increased automatic spreading activation underlies schizophrenia-typical language disturbances which in our study cannot be attributed to confounding variables such as diﬀerent reaction time baselines, medication or length of illness. Finally, results conﬁrm that the psychometric high-risk approach is an important tool for investigating issues relevant to schizophrenia.},

The schizophrenic sample also showed reduced parietal positivity and a reduced effect of congruity on the late positive component that follows N400. Within the schizophrenic sample, measures of attentional impairment and positive thought disorder were correlated with mean amplitude of both the N400 and the subsequent positivity. The results imply that the structure and spread of activation within semantic memory is not impaired in schizophrenia.

These 40 patients were assessed three times within a 10-day period at the outset of an acute psychotic episode with open-ended interviews which were then evaluated with the TLC. It was found that clinically rated speech disorders were relatively consistent within these patients at the outset of a psychotic episode. Furthermore, it was found that composite ratings of positive and negative speech disorders, as defined by the TLC, were stable discriminators of the manic and schizophrenic patients, while global thought disorder was not useful as a discriminator. The results provide evidence that thought disorder in psychosis may be a stable trait of patients during acute episodes and that positive and negative disorder is a useful construct.

	abstract = {Background
Affective flattening has been described as enduring, but long term follow-up studies of first episode psychosis patients are lacking.
Objective
The aim of this study was to follow the symptom development of flat affect (FA), over a 10year follow-up period, with focus on prevalence, predictors and outcome factors including social functioning.
Methods
Three-hundred-and-one patients with FEP were included at baseline, 186 participated in the 10year follow-up. These were followed on PANSS item N1 (FA) from baseline through 5 follow-up assessments over 10years. Patients were grouped as having never-present, improving, deteriorating, fluctuating or enduring FA. The groups were compared on baseline variables, variables at 10year follow-up, and social functioning throughout the follow-up period.
Results
Twenty nine percent never displayed FA, 66\% had improving, deteriorating or fluctuating FA, while 5\% of patients had enduring FA. Premorbid social function predicted enduring FA. The patients with enduring, fluctuating and deteriorating FA did poorer on all outcome variables, including remission and recovery rates. The enduring FA group did significantly poorer in social functioning over the 10year period.
Conclusions
FA is expressed at some point of time in the majority of FEP patients in a 10year follow-up period, and appears more fluctuant than expected from the relevant literature. FA is associated with poorer outcome after 10years, and enduring FA to poorer social function at all points of assessment.},

	abstract = {Background. There is a general consensus in the literature that schizophrenia causes diﬃculties with facial emotion perception and discrimination. Functional brain imaging studies have observed reduced limbic activity during facial emotion perception but few studies have examined the relation to ﬂat aﬀect severity.
Method. A total of 26 people with schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls took part in this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Sad, happy and neutral faces were presented in a pseudo-random order and participants indicated the gender of the face presented. Manual segmentation of the amygdala was performed on a structural T1 image.
Results. Both the schizophrenia group and the healthy control group rated the emotional valence of facial expressions similarly. Both groups exhibited increased brain activity during the perception of emotional faces relative to neutral ones in multiple brain regions, including multiple prefrontal regions bilaterally, the right amygdala, right cingulate cortex and cuneus. Group comparisons, however, revealed increased activity in the healthy group in the anterior cingulate, right parahippocampal gyrus and multiple visual areas. In schizophrenia, the severity of ﬂat aﬀect correlated signiﬁcantly with neural activity in several brain areas including the amygdala and parahippocampal region bilaterally.
Conclusions. These results suggest that many of the brain regions involved in emotional face perception, including the amygdala, are equally recruited in both schizophrenia and controls, but ﬂat aﬀect can also moderate activity in some other brain regions, notably in the left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally. There were no signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in the volume of the amygdala.},

Subjects were schizophrenic with flat affect (SZs), right brain-damaged (RBD), Parkinson's Disease (PDs), and normal control (NC) right-handed adults. Subjects were administered affective measures of expression and perception in both facial and vocal channels. For both perceptual and expressive tasks the SZs performed significantly less accurately than the NCs and the PDs but did not differ from the RBDs. This was the case for both face and voice.

	abstract = {Background
Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is one of the most characteristic features of schizophrenia. Several neuroimaging studies report spatially distinct neuroanatomical changes in association with FTD. Given that most studies so far have employed a univariate localisation approach that obscures the study of covarying interregional relationships, the present study focussed on the multivariate systemic pattern of anatomical changes that contribute to FTD.
Methods
Speech samples from nineteen medicated clinically stable schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls were evaluated for subtle formal thought disorder. Ultra high-field (7T) anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans were obtained from all subjects. Multivariate morphometric patterns were identified using an independent component approach (source based morphometry). Using multiple regression analysis, the morphometric patterns predicting positive and negative FTD scores were identified.
Results
Morphometric variations in grey matter predicted a substantial portion of inter-individual variance in negative but not positive FTD. A pattern of concomitant striato-insular/precuneus reduction along with frontocingular grey matter increase had a significant association with negative FTD.
Conclusions
These results suggest that concomitant increase and decrease in grey matter occur in association with persistent negative thought disorder in clinically stable individuals with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Background
Formal thought disorder (FTD) in schizophrenia has been found to be associated with volume reductions in the left superior temporal cortex. However, there have been negative findings and some studies have also found associations in other cortical regions.
Method
Fifty-one schizophrenic patients were evaluated for presence of FTD with the Thought, Language and Communication (TLC) scale and underwent whole-brain structural MRI using optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Fifty-nine matched healthy controls were also scanned.
Results
Compared to 31 patients without FTD (global TLC rating 0 or 1), 20 patients with FTD (global TLC rating 2–5) showed clusters of volume reduction in the medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, and in two left-sided areas approximating to Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The pattern of FTD-associated volume reductions was largely different from that found in a comparison between the healthy controls and the patients without FTD. Analysis of correlations within regions-of-interest based on the above clusters indicated that the ‘fluent disorganization’ component of FTD was correlated with volume reductions in both Broca's and Wernicke's areas, whereas poverty of content of speech was correlated with reductions in the medial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex.
Conclusions
The findings point to a relationship between FTD in schizophrenia and structural brain pathology in brain areas involved in language and executive function.},

impaired in their ability to use linguistic context to process sentences online (Kuperberg et al. 1998).
This study investigates the heterogeneity in the use of linguistic context both between individual TD
patients and within the individual patients as severity of thought disorder changes over time.Methods. Seventeen TD schizophrenics performed an online word-monitoring task on four
separate occasions. In each patient, baseline reaction time (RTs) to target words in normal sentences
were subtracted from RTs to target words in pragmatically-, semantically- and syntactically-violated sentences to obtain a measure of online sensitivity to each type of linguistic violation, and
these were compared with normative data of a healthy volunteer and a non-TD schizophrenic
control group. In addition, the co-variation of severity of thought disorder and sensitivity to
linguistic context within all individual TD patients over the four testing sessions, was examined.Results. There was marked heterogeneity between individual TD patients in their sensitivity to
different types of linguistic violations: some were selectively insensitive to pragmatic violations,
while others were insensitive to semantic and syntactic (subcategorization) violations. There was
also an inverse relationship between severity of thought disorder and sensitivity to linguistic
violations within individual patients over the four sessions.Conclusions. It is likely that a single cognitive deficit does not account for all types of schizophrenic
thought disorder, but rather that there are multiple deficits affecting specific levels of linguistic
processing. In these schizophrenic patients, impairment in the use of linguistic context was related
to the state, rather than the trait, of thought disorder.},

	abstract = {Objective
The notion of at-risk mental state (ARMS) is valuable for identifying individuals in a putative prodromal state of psychosis and for reducing conversion risk by pharmacological and psychological interventions. However, further systematic study is required because 1) diagnostic reliability in various clinical settings is not yet established; 2) predictive ability is insufficient; 3) optimal interventions in diversified populations are elusive; and 4) little evidence from non-Western regions exists.
Methods
A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted at a specialized clinic for early psychosis at a university hospital in Sendai, Japan. Individuals with ARMS (n=106) were recruited and followed up with case-by-case treatment.
Results
Two-thirds of the participants were psychiatrist referrals, and 83 were followed up for at-least 1year (mean follow-up=2.4years). Fourteen developed psychosis and the estimated (by Kaplan–Meier) cumulative transition rate was 11.1\% at 12, 15.4\% at 24, and 17.5\% at 30months. At the end-point, about 30\% of the 83 followed-up participants including 11 converters received antipsychotic medication. Compared to non-converters, converters showed more severe attenuated psychotic symptoms, including ego-boundary disturbance, formal thought disorder, and emotional disturbance.
Conclusions
The present study replicated previous major Western longitudinal studies, in terms of clinical characteristics, psychosis transition rate, and antipsychotic prescription rate. Our results emphasize the importance of phenomenological assessment of ARMS and intensive care in a clinical setting.},

TD schizophrenics were also less sensitive to linguistic violations in an off-line version of the task, in which they judged whether the sentences "made sense. " Finally, these participants produced more errors on a verbal fluency task than did non-TD schizophrenics or normal controls. These findings are consistent with the theory that schizophrenic thought disorder arises from a deficit in the use of linguistic ontext to process and produce speech.

In this study, we examined, in a sample of chronically institutionalized schizophrenia patients (N=317), whether two types of communication abnormalities (i.e., verbal underproductivity and disconnected speech) had differential relationships with social and adaptive outcomes. Baseline ratings of verbal underproductivity, disconnected speech, global cognitive performance, and clinical symptoms, were entered into stepwise regression analyses to examine their relationship with 2.5 year social and adaptive outcomes. At baseline, disconnected speech was significantly associated with socially impolite behavior, while verbal underproductivity was associated with social disengagement and impaired friendships. Both types of communication abnormalities were significantly associated with other types of social skills. Verbal underproductivity predicted follow-up social skills, social engagement, and friendships, accounting for more variance than. cognition or symptoms. In contrast to social outcomes, adaptive outcomes were predicted by baseline neurocognition and clinical symptoms, but not communication abnormalities. These findings provide evidence for specific relationships of communication disorder subtypes with diverse impairments in social functions. In this chronically institutionalized sample, communication disorder was a stronger predictor of social, but not adaptive, outcomes than neurocognition or clinical symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background. Thought disorder has been proposed as an indicator of schizotypy, which is considered to be necessary but not suﬃcient for the development of schizophrenia. It is unclear whether thought disorder is an indicator of susceptibility (i.e. an endophenotype) for schizophrenia. The goal of the present study was to elucidate the role of thought disorder in relation to schizotypy by examining its presence in high-risk individuals during mid-childhood.
Method. The sample consisted of 265 subjects drawn from the New York High-Risk Project. Individuals at high risk for schizophrenia (i.e. oﬀspring of parents with schizophrenia) were compared with individuals at low risk for schizophrenia (i.e. oﬀspring of parents with aﬀective disorder or oﬀspring of psychiatrically normal parents). Videotaped interviews were rated for thought disorder using the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language, and Communication (TLC). The same subjects were administered diagnostic interviews in late adolescence/early adulthood.
Results. Although positive thought disorder was equally present in subjects with aﬀective and non-aﬀective psychoses, negative thought disorder (namely, poverty of speech and poverty of content of speech) was elevated only in subjects with schizophrenia-related psychosis. Logistic regression analyses revealed that negative thought disorder added to the prediction of schizophrenia-related psychosis outcomes over and above positive thought disorder.
Conclusions. These ﬁndings suggest that negative thought disorder may have a speciﬁc association with schizotypy, rather than a more general association with psychosis. The ﬁndings also support consideration of negative thought disorder as an endophenotypic indicator of a schizophrenia diathesis.},

Although they are considered a core feature of schizophrenia, comparatively little work has been done to examine their impact on the life experiences of patients. This study aimed to examine the relationship between schizophrenia speech disturbances, including those traditionally known as formal thought disorder (TD), and quality of life (QoL). It assessed effects on functioning (objective QoL) and satisfaction (subjective QoL) concurrently, while controlling for the influence of neurocognition and depression. Fifty-four patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder were administered the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), the PANSS, MADRS (with separate ratings for negative TD [verbal underproductivity] and positive TD [verbal disorganisation and pressured speech]) and Lehman’s QOLI assessing both objective and subjective QoL. Ratings of positive and negative TD, depression, and general neurocognition were entered into hierarchical regressions to explore their relationship with both life functioning and satisfaction. Verbal underproductivity was a significant predictor of objective QoL, while pressured speech had a trend association with subjective QoL. This suggests a differential relationship between speech disturbances and QoL. Verbal underproductivity seems to affect daily functioning and relations with others, while pressured speech is predictive of satisfaction with life. The impact of verbal underproductivity on QoL suggests it to be an important target for rehabilitation in schizophrenia.},

Neuropsychological deficits had been observed at about age 9 in subjects with adulthood schizophrenia.

Methods: We rated thought disorder and symptoms from videotaped interviews at age 9, using the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC), and the Mental Health Assessment Form (MHAF). With factor analyses we examined the structure of the ratings, and from interpretable factors, scales were assembled. MANOVAs were used to examine the effect of parental risk and adulthood psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia-related psychosis (SRP), major affective disorder (MAD), no disorder/other (NoDx/other)) as independent variables (IV) on thought disorder and symptoms as dependent variables. Results: Global, positive and negative thought disorder, and negative symptoms were significantly higher in subjects with adulthood schizophrenia-related psychosis than both comparison groups. A significant interaction between the two IVs was effective with respect to positive thought disorder. This scale was particularly elevated among subjects with adulthood schizophrenia-related psychosis at parental risk for affective disorder (all of whom had adulthood schizoaffective disorder). Conclusions: We were able to show that global, negative and positive thought disorder and negative symptoms were present in subjects with adulthood schizophrenia already at mid-childhood, years before onset of psychosis. Further, we found a particularly high propensity to positive symptoms in subjects with adulthood schizophrenia who have also an affective component in their symptoms.

Partial correlation analysis, controlling for age and word knowledge, revealed significant results for the objective positive FTD dimension and executive dysfunctions.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Negative symptoms are a critical, but poorly understood, aspect of schizophrenia. Measurement of negative symptoms primarily relies on clinician ratings, an endeavor with established reliability and validity. There have been increasing attempts to digitally phenotype negative symptoms using objective biobehavioral technologies, eg, using computerized analysis of vocal, speech, facial, hand and other behaviors. Surprisingly, biobehavioral technologies and clinician ratings are only modestly inter-related, and findings from individual studies often do not replicate or are counterintuitive. In this article, we document and evaluate this lack of convergence in 4 case studies, in an archival dataset of 877 audio/video samples, and in the extant literature. We then explain this divergence in terms of “resolution”—a critical psychometric property in biomedical, engineering, and computational sciences defined as precision in distinguishing various aspects of a signal. We demonstrate how convergence between clinical ratings and biobehavioral data can be achieved by scaling data across various resolutions. Clinical ratings reflect an indispensable tool that integrates considerable information into actionable, yet “low resolution” ordinal ratings. This allows viewing of the “forest” of negative symptoms. Unfortunately, their resolution cannot be scaled or decomposed with sufficient precision to isolate the time, setting, and nature of negative symptoms for many purposes (ie, to see the “trees”). Biobehavioral measures afford precision for understanding when, where, and why negative symptoms emerge, though much work is needed to validate them. Digital phenotyping of negative symptoms can provide unprecedented opportunities for tracking, understanding, and treating them, but requires consideration of resolution.},

In order to better understand vocal deficits in schizophrenia and to advance acoustic analytic technologies for clinical and research applications, we examined archived speech samples from five separate studies, each employing different speaking tasks (patient N = 309; control N = 117). We sought to: a) employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify independent vocal expression measures from a large set of variables, b) quantify how patients with schizophrenia are abnormal with respect to these variables, c) evaluate the impact of demographic and contextual factors (e.g., study site, speaking task), and d) examine the relationship between clinically–rated psychiatric symptoms and vocal variables. PCA identified seven independent markers of vocal expression. Most of these vocal variables varied considerably as a function of context and many were associated with demographic factors. After controlling for context and demographics, there were no meaningful differences in vocal expression between patients and controls. Within patients, vocal variables were associated with a range of psychiatric symptoms – though only pause length was significantly associated with clinically-rated negative symptoms. The discussion centers on explaining the apparent discordance between clinical and computerized speech measures.},

Natália Mota from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, and colleagues asked 21 people undergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and 21 healthy controls to recall a dream or recent memory. They then analyzed the structure of the participants’ verbal reports using a mathematical technique. The patients were followed up during 6 months to establish a more formal diagnosis. The researchers found that those later diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibited more disorganized speech (almost random in structure) at the initial doctor’s visit than those later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Less connected speech among people with schizophrenia was also indicative of more severe negative symptoms such as blunted emotions and lack of motivation.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Background: Psychosis has various causes, including mania and schizophrenia. Since the differential diagnosis of psychosis is exclusively based on subjective assessments of oral interviews with patients, an objective quantification of the speech disturbances that characterize mania and schizophrenia is in order. In principle, such quantification could be achieved by the analysis of speech graphs. A graph represents a network with nodes connected by edges; in speech graphs, nodes correspond to words and edges correspond to semantic and grammatical relationships.
Methodology/Principal Findings: To quantify speech differences related to psychosis, interviews with schizophrenics, manics and normal subjects were recorded and represented as graphs. Manics scored significantly higher than schizophrenics in ten graph measures. Psychopathological symptoms such as logorrhea, poor speech, and flight of thoughts were grasped by the analysis even when verbosity differences were discounted. Binary classifiers based on speech graph measures sorted schizophrenics from manics with up to 93.8\% of sensitivity and 93.7\% of specificity. In contrast, sorting based on the scores of two standard psychiatric scales (BPRS and PANSS) reached only 62.5\% of sensitivity and specificity.
Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrate that alterations of the thought process manifested in the speech of psychotic patients can be objectively measured using graph-theoretical tools, developed to capture specific features of the normal and dysfunctional flow of thought, such as divergence and recurrence. The quantitative analysis of speech graphs is not redundant with standard psychometric scales but rather complementary, as it yields a very accurate sorting of schizophrenics and manics. Overall, the results point to automated psychiatric diagnosis based not on what is said, but on how it is said.},

In search of quantitative insight into the structure of psychotic speech, we investigated speech graph attributes (SGA) in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder type I and non-psychotic controls as they reported waking and dream contents. Schizophrenic subjects spoke with reduced connectivity, in tight correlation with negative and cognitive symptoms measured by standard psychometric scales. Bipolar and control subjects were undistinguishable by waking reports, but in dream reports bipolar subjects showed significantly less connectivity. Dream-related SGA outperformed psychometric scores or waking-related data for group sorting. Altogether, the results indicate that online and offline processing, the two most fundamental modes of brain operation, produce nearly opposite effects on recollections: While dreaming exposes differences in the mnemonic records across individuals, waking dampens distinctions. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of the differential diagnosis of psychosis based on the analysis of dream graphs, pointing to a fast, low-cost and language-invariant tool for psychiatric diagnosis and the objective search for biomarkers. The Freudian notion that “dreams are the royal road to the unconscious” is clinically useful, after all.},

Critically, these features are of prognostic value in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and for those in early stages of psychotic disorders. Motor abnormalities such as tremor, rigidity, and neurological soft signs often go unrecognized. Currently, advances in this area are limited by a paucity of theoretical conceptions categorizing or linking these behaviours to underlying neurobiology affected in psychosis. However, emerging technological advances have significantly improved the ability to detect and assess motor abnormalities with objective instruments in a timely and reliable manner. Further, converging evidence has laid the groundwork for theoretically and empirically derived categorization and conceptualization. This review summarizes these advances, stressing the importance of motor abnormalities for understanding vulnerability across different stages of psychosis and introducing these innovative instrumental approaches. Patients, researchers and clinicians will benefit from these new developments, as better assessment aids the development of targeted interventions to ultimately improve the care for individuals experiencing psychosis.},

They attempt to define the broad range of language, thought, and communication behaviors observed in patients and are not limited to those considered characteristic of schizophrenia.

It indicates that some types of thought disorder considered important occur so infrequently as to be of little diagnostic value, such as neologisms or blocking. The traditional concept of thought disorder, which emphasizes associative loosening, is also of little value, since associative loosening occurs frequently in mania as well as in schizophrenia. This investigation demonstrates that associative loosening can no longer be considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia. On the other hand, an approach that defines various subtypes of thought disorder and uses a concept of negative-vs-positive thought disorder does often permit a distinction between mania and schizophrenia. It is recommended that the practice of referring globally to "thought disorder," as if it were homogeneous, be avoided in the future and instead that the specific subtypes occurring in particular patients be noted in both clinical practice and research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Individuals with serious mental illness experience changes in their clinical states over time that are difficult to assess and that result in increased disease burden and care utilization. It is not known if features derived from speech can serve as a transdiagnostic marker of these clinical states. This study evaluates the feasibility of collecting speech samples from people with serious mental illness and explores the potential utility for tracking changes in clinical state over time. Patients (n = 47) were recruited from a community-based mental health clinic with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients used an interactive voice response system for at least 4 months to provide speech samples. Clinic providers (n = 13) reviewed responses and provided global assessment ratings. We computed features of speech and used machine learning to create models of outcome measures trained using either population data or an individual’s own data over time. The system was feasible to use, recording 1101 phone calls and 117 hours of speech. Most (92\%) of the patients agreed that it was easy to use. The individually-trained models demonstrated the highest correlation with provider ratings (rho = 0.78, p{\textless}0.001). Population-level models demonstrated statistically significant correlations with provider global assessment ratings (rho = 0.44, p{\textless}0.001), future provider ratings (rho = 0.33, p{\textless}0.05), BASIS-24 summary score, depression sub score, and self-harm sub score (rho = 0.25,0.25, and 0.28 respectively; p{\textless}0.05), and the SF-12 mental health sub score (rho = 0.25, p{\textless}0.05), but not with other BASIS-24 or SF-12 sub scores. This study brings together longitudinal collection of objective behavioral markers along with a transdiagnostic, personalized approach for tracking of mental health clinical state in a community-based clinical setting.},

	volume = {50},
	abstract = {Objective
Given the fundamental role of thought disorder in schizophrenia, subtle communication disturbance may be a valuable predictor of subsequent development of psychosis. Here we examined the contribution of thought and communication disturbance to the prediction of outcome in adolescents identified as putatively prodromal for psychosis.
Method
Transcribed speech samples were elicited from 105 adolescents (54 identified as being at clinical high risk for a first episode of psychosis [CHR], and 51 demographically comparable comparison subjects) and coded for formal thought disorder (FTD) and linguistic cohesion. We then examined the association of baseline FTD/cohesion with conversion to psychosis and social and role outcome at follow-up, approximately 1 year later.
Results
At baseline, CHR patients who subsequently converted to psychosis (CHR+) showed an elevated rate of illogical thinking and poverty of content (POC) in their speech, relative to both typically developing controls and CHR patients who did not convert to psychosis (CHR−). CHR+ youth also used significantly less referential cohesion at baseline, indicating that they provide fewer references to persons, objects, or events mentioned in preceding utterances. Multiple regression models indicated that, among measures of FTD/cohesion, illogical thinking was uniquely predictive of subsequent conversion to psychosis, whereas POC and referential cohesion were significant predictors of social and role functioning, respectively.
Conclusions
Despite the absence of fully psychotic symptoms, putatively prodromal individuals evidence signs of communication disturbance that are qualitatively similar to those seen in schizophrenia and are predictive of both conversion to psychosis and psychosocial outcome. These findings suggest that FTD measures have prognostic significance for at-risk youth.},

Existing relapse evaluation strategies are limited by their reliance on direct and timely contact with professionals, and accurate reporting of symptoms. A method by which to objectively identify early relapse warning signs could facilitate swift intervention. We collected 52,815 Facebook posts across 51 participants with recent onset psychosis (mean age = 23.96 years; 70.58\% male) and applied anomaly detection to explore linguistic and behavioral changes associated with psychotic relapse. We built a one-class classification model that makes patient-specific personalized predictions on risk to relapse. Significant differences were identified in the words posted to Facebook in the month preceding a relapse hospitalization compared to periods of relative health, including increased usage of words belonging to the swear (p {\textless} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test), anger (p {\textless} 0.001), and death (p {\textless} 0.0001) categories, decreased usage of words belonging to work (p = 0.00579), friends (p {\textless} 0.0001), and health (p {\textless} 0.0001) categories, as well as a significantly increased use of first (p {\textless} 0.0001) and second-person (p  {\textless} 0.001) pronouns. We additionally observed a significant increase in co-tagging (p {\textless} 0.001) and friending (p {\textless} 0.0001) behaviors in the month before a relapse hospitalization. Our classifier achieved a specificity of 0.71 in predicting relapse.

To date, limited efforts have included expert input to evaluate the authenticity of diagnostic self-disclosures. Objective: This study aims to move from noisy self-reports of schizophrenia on social media to more accurate identification of diagnoses by exploring a human-machine partnered approach, wherein computational linguistic analysis of shared content is combined with clinical appraisals. Methods: Twitter timeline data, extracted from 671 users with self-disclosed diagnoses of schizophrenia, was appraised for authenticity by expert clinicians. Data from disclosures deemed true were used to build a classifier aiming to distinguish users with schizophrenia from healthy controls. Results from the classifier were compared to expert appraisals on new, unseen Twitter users. Results: Significant linguistic differences were identified in the schizophrenia group including greater use of interpersonal pronouns (P{\textless}.001), decreased emphasis on friendship (P{\textless}.001), and greater emphasis on biological processes (P{\textless}.001). The resulting classifier distinguished users with disclosures of schizophrenia deemed genuine from control users with a mean accuracy of 88\% using linguistic data alone. Compared to clinicians on new, unseen users, the classifier’s precision, recall, and accuracy measures were 0.27, 0.77, and 0.59, respectively. Conclusions: These data reinforce the need for ongoing collaborations integrating expertise from multiple fields to strengthen our ability to accurately identify and effectively engage individuals with mental illness online. These collaborations are crucial to overcome some of mental illnesses’ biggest challenges by using digital technology.  [J Med Internet Res 2017;19(8):e289]},

Normal volunteers asked to identify intermediate phonemes along the /ba/ to /da/ continuum abruptly switch from perceiving “ba” to perceiving “da”. The present study investigates precision of phonemic processing in schizophrenia. Methods: Categorical perception of speech sounds was evaluated in 15 schizophrenic and 14 control subjects, using a forced-choice phonemic discrimination paradigm. Results: Patients and controls were equally able to recognize endpoint forms of both phonemes, but differed significantly in their perception of intermediate forms near the center of the continuum. Patients also showed a significantly shallower response curve, suggesting an impairment in boundary definition. Despite their impairment in categorical perception, schizophrenic subjects showed normal adaptation of response when test stimuli were preceded by a series of /ba/ or /da/ stimuli from the endpoints of the continuum. Conclusions: The present results suggest that precision of phonemic processing is impaired in schizophrenia. This categorical perception deficit may represent upward generalization of impaired memory-dependent acoustic processing. Deficits in the precision of cortical processing may contribute significantly to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

For this purpose we used the Assessment Battery of Communication (ABaCo; Sacco et al., 2008). The ABaCo is a validated clinical tool for assessing pragmatic skills, which comprises five evaluation scales—linguistic, extralinguistic, paralinguistic, context, and conversational—investigating both comprehension and production of the main pragmatic phenomena involved in a communicative exchange, such as direct and indirect speech acts, irony, deceit, the violation of Grice's maxims, topic management, and turn-taking. The battery was administered to a group of seventeen patients with schizophrenia, and matched healthy controls. We expected the clinical group to perform widely worse than the control group in the different pragmatic dimensions investigated. Results showed that patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than controls on all the five scales of the battery, both in comprehension and production tasks. Moreover, the results within each scale showed a differentiated performance in the clinical group among the pragmatic phenomena, with irony assessed as the most difficult task. The implications of these results for research and treatment in schizophrenia are discussed.

	abstract = {Objective
Acoustic phonetic methods are useful in examining some symptoms of schizophrenia; we used such methods to understand the underpinnings of aprosody. We hypothesized that, compared to controls and patients without clinically rated aprosody, patients with aprosody would exhibit reduced variability in: pitch (F0), jaw/mouth opening and tongue height (formant F1), tongue front/back position and/or lip rounding (formant F2), and intensity/loudness.
Methods
Audiorecorded speech was obtained from 98 patients (including 25 with clinically rated aprosody and 29 without) and 102 unaffected controls using five tasks: one describing a drawing, two based on spontaneous speech elicited through a question (Tasks 2 and 3), and two based on reading prose excerpts (Tasks 4 and 5). We compared groups on variation in pitch (F0), formant F1 and F2, and intensity/loudness.
Results
Regarding pitch variation, patients with aprosody differed significantly from controls in Task 5 in both unadjusted tests and those adjusted for sociodemographics. For the standard deviation (SD) of F1, no significant differences were found in adjusted tests. Regarding SD of F2, patients with aprosody had lower values than controls in Task 3, 4, and 5. For variation in intensity/loudness, patients with aprosody had lower values than patients without aprosody and controls across the five tasks.

Findings could represent a step toward developing new methods for measuring and tracking the severity of this specific negative symptom using acoustic phonetic parameters; such work is relevant to other psychiatric and neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {Language and speech are the primary source of data for psychiatrists to diagnose and treat mental disorders. In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier – comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns – that had an 83\% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79\% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72\% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention.

Thought disorder appears to be primarily a disruption of executive function and pragmatics, perhaps with impairment of the syntax–semantics interface; schizophasia involves disruption at other levels. Phonetics is also often abnormal (manifesting as flat intonation or unusual voice quality), but phonological structure, morphology, and syntax are normal or nearly so (some syntactic impairments have been demonstrated). Access to the lexicon is clearly impaired, manifesting as stilted speech, word approximation, and neologism. Clanging (glossomania) is straightforwardly explainable as distraction by self-monitoring.

	abstract = {Background
Aprosody, or flattened speech intonation, is a recognized negative symptom of schizophrenia, though it has rarely been studied from a linguistic/phonological perspective. To bring the latest advances in computational linguistics to the phenomenology of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, a clinical first-episode psychosis research team joined with a phonetics/computational linguistics team to conduct a preliminary, proof-of-concept study.
Methods
Video recordings from a semi-structured clinical research interview were available from 47 first-episode psychosis patients. Audio tracks of the video recordings were extracted, and after review of quality, 25 recordings were available for phonetic analysis. These files were de-noised and a trained phonologist extracted a 1-minute sample of each patient's speech. WaveSurfer 1.8.5 was used to create, from each speech sample, a file of formant values (F0, F1, F2, where F0 is the fundamental frequency and F1 and F2 are resonance bands indicating the moment-by-moment shape of the oral cavity). Variability in these phonetic indices was correlated with severity of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale negative symptom scores using Pearson correlations.
Results
A measure of variability of tongue front-to-back position—the standard deviation of F2—was statistically significantly correlated with the severity of negative symptoms (r=−0.446, p=0.03).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates a statistically significant and meaningful correlation between negative symptom severity and phonetically measured reductions in tongue movements during speech in a sample of first-episode patients just initiating treatment.

	abstract = {Background
Prior studies have implicated baseline positive and negative symptoms as predictors of psychosis onset among individuals at clinical high risk (CHR), but none have evaluated latent trajectories of symptoms over time. This study evaluated the dynamic evolution of symptoms leading to psychosis onset in a CHR cohort.
Method
100 CHR participants were assessed quarterly for up to 2.5years. Latent trajectory analysis was used to identify patterns of symptom change. Logistic and proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the predictive value for psychosis onset of baseline symptoms and symptom trajectories.
Results
Transition rate to psychosis was 26\%. Disorganized communication (i.e., subthreshold thought disorder) presented an increased hazard for psychosis onset, both at baseline (Hazard Ratio (95\% CI)=1.4 (1.1–1.9)) and as a trajectory of high persistent disorganized communication (Hazard Ratio (95\% CI)=2.2 (1.0–4.9)). Interval clinical data did not improve the predictive value of baseline symptoms for psychosis onset.
Conclusions
High baseline disorganized communication evident at ascertainment tended to persist and lead to psychosis onset, consistent with prior behavioral and speech analysis studies in similar cohorts. Remediation of language dysfunction therefore may be a candidate strategy for preventive intervention.},

Given the time-consuming, and often subjective nature of discourse analysis, these deviances are frequently not assayed in large scale studies. Recent work in computational linguistics and statistical-based semantic analysis has shown the potential and power of automated analysis of communication. We present an automated and objective approach to modeling discourse that detects very subtle deviations between probands, their first-degree relatives and unrelated healthy controls. Although these findings should be regarded as preliminary due to the limitations of the data at our disposal, we present a brief analysis of the models that best differentiate these groups in order to illustrate the utility of the method for future explorations of how language components are differentially affected by familial and illness related issues.},

However, measuring incoherence has often been complex and subjective. We sought to validate an objective, intrinsically reliable, computational approach to quantifying speech incoherence. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy control volunteers were administered a variety of language tasks. The speech generated was transcribed and the coherence computed using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The discourse was also analyzed with a standard clinical measure of thought disorder. In word association and generation tasks LSA derived coherence scores were sensitive to differences between patients and controls, and correlated with clinical measures of thought disorder. In speech samples LSA could be used to localize where in sentence production incoherence occurs, predict levels of incoherence as well as whether discourse “belonged” to a patient or control. In conclusion, LSA can be used to assay disordered language production so as to both complement human clinical ratings as well as experimentally parse this incoherence in a theory-driven manner.},

            Automated extraction of quantitative linguistic features has the potential to predict objectively the onset and progression of psychosis. These linguistic variables are often considered to be biomarkers, with a large emphasis placed on the pathological aberrations in the biological processes that underwrite the faculty of language in psychosis. This perspective offers a reminder that human language is primarily a social device that is biologically implemented. As such, linguistic aberrations in patients with psychosis reflect both social and biological processes affecting an individual. Failure to consider the sociolinguistic aspects of NLP measures will limit their usefulness as digital tools in clinical settings. In the context of psychosis, considering language as a biosocial marker could lead to less biased and more accessible tools for patient-specific predictions in the clinic.},

We appreciate the efforts of Hunter and colleagues to understand risk factors for mental illness that may disproportionately impact Black Americans. However, their study, “Black American Maternal Prenatal Choline, Offspring Gestational Age at Birth, and Developmental Predisposition to Mental Illness,” in Schizophrenia Bulletin1 builds on a problematic foundation of considering race to be a biological entity rather than a social construct. Race has been conceptualized as a multidimensional socially constructed entity that includes racial identity, self-classification, observed race, reflected race, phenotype, and racial ancestry.2 Limiting the concept of race to one or a few of these dimensions and using them as a proxy for this complex construct can lead to findings that are not generalizable. In addition, when mentioning the higher rates of psychotic spectrum disorders in Black Americans, it is important to acknowledge the role of implicit bias and racism in differential rates of diagnosis.3},

Rather than taking for granted existing categories for parsing and classifying race and language, we seek to understand how and why these categories have been co-naturalized, and to imagine their denaturalization as part of a broader structural project of contesting white supremacy. We explore five key components of a raciolinguistic perspective: (i) historical and contemporary colonial co-naturalizations of race and language; (ii) perceptions of racial and linguistic difference; (iii) regimentations of racial and linguistic categories; (iv) racial and linguistic intersections and assemblages; and (v) contestations of racial and linguistic power formations. These foci reflect our investment in developing a careful theorization of various forms of racial and linguistic inequality on the one hand, and our commitment to the imagination and creation of more just societies on the other.

DeMatteo and Edens (2006) first summarized the extant U.S. case law on the PCL-R, identifying 87 cases in which it had been introduced since its publication in 1991 through 2004. Using an identical search strategy employed in the earlier review (LexisNexis legal database), we identified 348 cases involving the PCL-R from 2005 through 2011. Notably, the PCL-R appeared to be primarily a “prosecution tool” in these cases in that it was rarely first introduced into evidence by the defense. In most cases it was used to assess offenders with significant histories of violence in the context of risk assessments—with resulting risk statements being strongly associated with the results of the PCL-R evaluation (i.e., high psychopathy equating with high recidivism risk, low psychopathy equating with low recidivism risk). Challenges to the admissibility of PCL-R evidence in these cases were rare and typically unsuccessful, even though some assertions, particularly in relation to the PCL-R’s predictive validity, appeared to have questionable scientific support. On average, prosecution examiners reported PCL-R scores that were 7 points higher than defense examiners. We discuss these findings in the context of the appropriate roles for the PCL-R in court and its potential for misuse when evaluating psycho-legal issues.},

	abstract = {Background: Futurists have predicted that new autonomous technologies, embedded with artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will lead to substantial job losses in many sectors disrupting many aspects of healthcare. Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers.
Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community’s opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratiﬁed sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to veriﬁed and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist’s perceptions about whether beneﬁts of AI/ML would outweigh the risks.
Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Paciﬁc. Only 3.8 \% of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 \% felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 \%) and synthesizing information (54 \%) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and USbased doctors were more uncertain that the beneﬁts of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.},

	abstract = {Background
Futurists have predicted that new autonomous technologies, embedded with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will lead to substantial job losses in many sectors disrupting many aspects of healthcare. Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers.
Objective
To characterize the global psychiatrist community’s opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice.
Design
Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians.
Main outcome measures
We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist’s perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks.
Results
Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 \% of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 \% felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 \%) and synthesizing information (54 \%) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML.
Conclusions
Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.},

Specifically, algorithms powered by deep learning are already gaining increasingly wide adoption in fields such as radiology, pathology, and preventive medicine. Forensic psychiatry is a complex and intricate specialty that seeks to balance the disparate approaches of psychiatric science, which strives to explain human behavior deterministically, and the law, which emphasizes free choice and moral responsibility. This balancing, a central task of the forensic psychiatrist, is necessarily fraught with ambiguity. Such a complex task may intuitively seem impenetrable to artificial intelligence. This article first aims to challenge this assumption and then seeks to address the unique concerns posed by the adoption of artificial intelligence in violence risk assessment and prediction. The relevant ethics concerns are analyzed within the framework of traditional bioethics principles. Finally, recommendations for practitioners, ethicists, and others are offered as a starting point for further discussion.},

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classiﬁcation system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We ﬁnd that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classiﬁcation systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassiﬁed group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classiﬁcation systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

	abstract = {Researchers have repeatedly observed that clinicians diagnose Black individuals with schizophrenia at greater rates than White individuals. We conducted a meta-analytic review to quantify the extent of racial diagnostic disparities in schizophrenia, examine whether structured-interview assessments attenuate these disparities, and assess for moderating factors. Studies were included that presented original probability-sample data and reported data sufficient to derive odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for schizophrenia diagnosis by race. In total, 14 studies using structured-interview diagnostic assessments and 41 studies using unstructured assessments met our inclusion criteria. Substantial heterogeneity was observed, but there was little evidence of publication bias. Inverse heterogeneity models showed that Black individuals were diagnosed with schizophrenia at greater rates than White individuals across all studies (OR = 2.42, 95\% CI [1.59, 3.66]) as well as in studies using unstructured (OR = 2.43, 95\% CI [1.59, 3.72]) and structured-instrument (OR = 1.77, 95\% CI [1.31, 2.38]) diagnostic assessments. Studies using structured-instrument diagnostic assessments did not show statistically attenuated odds ratios compared with studies using unstructured assessments. Metaregression analyses indicated higher disparities in studies with higher proportions of White patients or lower average patient age; evidence was equivocal as to the effect of study setting (e.g., hospital vs. community clinic) and geographic region on racial disparities. Overall, racial diagnostic disparity in schizophrenia represents a robust albeit heterogeneous clinical phenomenon that has been stable over the past 3 decades; structured-instrument assessments do not fully mitigate these disparities, but power analysis suggests they may have a small effect.

However, virtually none of these datasets have been acquired with consideration of fair distribution across the human population. Therefore, in this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of bias and fairness in facial expression recognition by comparing three different approaches, namely a baseline, an attribute-aware and a disentangled approach, on two well-known datasets, RAF-DB and CelebA. Our results indicate that: (i) data augmentation improves the accuracy of the baseline model, but this alone is unable to mitigate the bias effect; (ii) both the attribute-aware and the disentangled approaches equipped with data augmentation perform better than the baseline approach in terms of accuracy and fairness; (iii) the disentangled approach is the best for mitigating demographic bias; and (iv) the bias mitigation strategies are more suitable in the existence of uneven attribute distribution or imbalanced number of subgroup data.},

Effective identification depends on factors beyond psychopathology as it is reflected in the current literature, such as sensitivity to idiographic circumstances and individual differences. The inability to address contextual factors when employing the status quo method of identification likely contributes to the unacceptably poor accuracy when identifying people at CHR. Individual differences related to factors such as culture, race, comorbidity, and development likely play an important role in accurate identification, and have the potential to improve the validity of approaches intended to identify this population. Tailored approaches to assessment based on an awareness of context, identity, setting, and preferences of clients are possible, and customizing assessment efforts accordingly may be useful for accurate identification of people at CHR. Highlighting the potential for the existing early identification paradigm to marginalize or misunderstand certain groups, we describe how effective identification and ethical diagnosis require sensitivity to individual differences writ large. We suggest that recognizing the importance of these factors advances a more inclusive and accurate approach to identification.},

	abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is ﬁrst shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender deﬁnition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms signiﬁcantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

	abstract = {Thought disorder – linguistic disturbances including incoherence and derailment of topic – is seen in individuals both with and at risk for psychosis. Methods from computational linguistics have increasingly sought to quantify thought disorder to detect group differences between clinical populations and healthy controls. While previous work has been quite successful at these classification tasks, the lack of interpretability of the computational metrics has made it unclear whether they are in fact measuring thought disorder. In this paper, we dive into these measures to try to better understand what they reflect. While we find group differences between at-risk and healthy control populations, we also find that the measures mostly do not correlate with existing measures of thought disorder symptoms (what they are intended to measure), but rather correlate with surface properties of the speech (e.g., sentence length) and sociodemographic properties of the speaker (e.g., race). These results highlight the importance of considering interpretability and front and center as the field continues to grow. Ethical use of computational measures like those studied here – especially in the high-stakes context of clinical care – requires us to devote substantial attention to potential biases in our measures.},

Disturbances in communication are a hallmark of severe mental illnesses. Recent technological advances have paved the way for objectifying communication using automated computerized linguistic and acoustic analysis. We review recent studies applying various computer-based assessments to the natural language produced by adult patients with severe mental illness.

Recent Findings
Automated computerized methods afford tools with which it is possible to objectively evaluate patients in a reliable, valid and efficient manner that complements human ratings. Crucially, these measures correlate with important clinical measures. The clinical relevance of these novel metrics has been demonstrated by showing their relationship to functional outcome measures, their in vivo link to classic ‘language’ regions in the brain, and, in the case of linguistic analysis, their relationship to candidate genes for severe mental illness.

Summary
Computer based assessments of natural language afford a framework with which to measure communication disturbances in adults with SMI. Emerging evidence suggests that they can be reliable and valid, and overcome many practical limitations of more traditional assessment methods. The advancement of these technologies offers unprecedented potential for measuring and understanding some of the most crippling symptoms of some of the most debilitating illnesses known to humankind.},

As yet, our treatments for negative symptoms are palliative at best and our understanding of their causes is relatively superficial. To address this, we are developing objective ambulatory tools for digitally phenotyping their severity which can be used outside the confines of the traditional clinical and research settings. The present study evaluated the feasibility, reliability and validity of ambulatory vocal acoustic and facial emotion expression analysis. Videos were provided by 25 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 27 nonpsychiatric controls using inexpensive, non-invasive ambulatory recording methods. Controls provided 411 video recordings, and patients provided 377 video recordings; an average of 15.22 and 14.50 per participant per group respectively. The vast majority (over 80\%) of these videos were usable for analysis. An empirically-supported, limited-feature vocal (7 features) and facial (3 features) set was examined. Within participants, these features varied considerably over time, but showed moderate to good test-retest reliability in many cases once contextual factors (e.g., activity involved in at the time of testing) were accounted for. Vocal and facial features showed statistically significant convergence with a “gold standard” negative symptom measure. Ambulatory vocal/facial features were more strongly associated with engagement in social or work activities in patients than negative symptom ratings. These data support the use of ambulatory vocal/facial analytic technologies for digital phenotyping of these negative symptoms.},

Methods: Visual and auditory markers were acquired through an automated smartphone task that measures facial, vocal, and head movement characteristics across four weeks of treatment (with timepoints at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks) on ADT (n = 18). MDD diagnosis was confirmed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was collected concordantly to assess changes in MDD severity. Results: Patient responses to ADT demonstrated clinically and statistically significant changes in the MADRS F(2,34) = 51.62, p {\textless}.0001. Additionally, patients demonstrated significant increases in multiple digital markers including facial expressivity, head movement, and amount of speech.

A quantitative approach of counting requirements changes and using engineering documentation enabled traceability from observation back to root cause origin. The development process was partitioned into sequential program segments, to categorize activities to before and after concept and design freeze. We found that there was a significant difference in the rate of design defects arising before and after concept freeze; and found there was a significantly higher number of corrective activities required for design defects arising earlier before concept freeze. The revision rate of concept phase decisions was over 50\%, and the rework multiplier if detected late was over 10X. In combination, design decisions made before design freeze accounted for 86\% of the total expected program cost, and 34\% was determined before concept freeze.

Autobiographical reasoning was defined as making connections between the past and the self, the effort reported in making those connections and the emotional evaluation of the connections. Personality differences at the levels of traits and ego development were examined in relation to autobiographical reasoning. One hundred and nineteen younger and older adults completed a self-defining memory interview. Self-event connections reported in the interviews were coded as being about dispositions, values, outlook, and personal growth. Connections were then coded for the degree of cognitive effort required to make the connection and the emotional evaluation of the connection. Finally, the entire interview was coded for the presence or absence of a theme. Results showed that cognitive effort and evaluation differed across type of connection, and ego development and traits moderated some of these results. Further, across connections, there were individual differences in cognitive effort and evaluation, as well as in the reports of a themes across memories. Results are discussed in terms of individual differences in the construction of narrative identity.},

Our approach focused on dynamic descriptors of facial expressions, employing motion history image, combined with appearance-based feature extraction algorithms (local binary patterns, histogram of oriented gradients), and visual geometry group features derived using deep learning networks through transfer learning. The relative performance of various alternative feature description and extraction techniques was first evaluated on a novel dataset comprising patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression (\$\$n=20\$\$) and healthy volunteers (\$\$n=45\$\$). Among various schemes involving depression measures as outcomes, best performance was obtained for continuous assessment of depression severity (as opposed to binary classification of patients and healthy volunteers). Comparable performance was achieved on a benchmark dataset, the audio/visual emotion challenge (AVEC’14). Regarding clinical specificity, results indicated that the proposed methodology was more accurate in detecting visual signs associated with self-reported anxiety symptoms.

Available clinical facial expression evaluations provide subjective and qualitative measurements, which are based on static 2D images that do not capture the temporal dynamics and subtleties of expression changes. Therefore, there is a need for automated, objective and quantitative measurements of facial expressions captured using videos. This paper presents a computational framework that creates probabilistic expression profiles for video data and can potentially help to automatically quantify emotional expression differences between patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy controls. Our method automatically detects and tracks facial landmarks in videos, and then extracts geometric features to characterize facial expression changes. To analyze temporal facial expression changes, we employ probabilistic classifiers that analyze facial expressions in individual frames, and then propagate the probabilities throughout the video to capture the temporal characteristics of facial expressions. The applications of our method to healthy controls and case studies of patients with schizophrenia and Asperger's syndrome demonstrate the capability of the video-based expression analysis method in capturing subtleties of facial expression. Such results can pave the way for a video-based method for quantitative analysis of facial expressions in clinical research of disorders that cause affective deficits.},

	abstract = {In schizophrenia, nonverbal behavior, including body movement, is of theoretical and clinical importance. Although reduced nonverbal expressiveness is a major component of the negative symptoms encountered in schizophrenia, few studies have objectively assessed body movement during social interaction. In the present study, 378 brief, videotaped role-play scenes involving 27 stabilized outpatients diagnosed with paranoid-type schizophrenia were analyzed using Motion Energy Analysis (MEA). This method enables the objective measuring of body movement in conjunction with ordinary video recordings. Correlations between movement parameters (percentage of time in movement, movement speed) and symptom ratings from independent PANSS interviews were calculated. Movement parameters proved to be highly reliable. In keeping with predictions, reduced movement and movement speed correlated with negative symptoms. Accordingly, in patients who exhibited noticeable movement for less than 20\% of the observation time, prominent negative symptoms were highly probable. As a control measure, the percentage of movement exhibited by the patients during role-play scenes was compared to that of their normal interactants. Patients with negative symptoms differed from normal interactants by showing significantly reduced head and body movement. Two specific positive symptoms were possibly related to movement parameters: suspiciousness tended to correlate with reduced head movement, and the expression of unusual thought content tended to relate to increased movement. Overall, a close and theoretically meaningful association between the objective movement parameters and the symptom profiles was found. MEA appears to be an objective, reliable and valid method for quantifying nonverbal behavior, an aspect which may furnish new insights into the processes related to reduced expressiveness in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Objective
Acoustic phonetic methods are useful in examining some symptoms of schizophrenia; we used such methods to understand the underpinnings of aprosody. We hypothesized that, compared to controls and patients without clinically rated aprosody, patients with aprosody would exhibit reduced variability in: pitch (F0), jaw/mouth opening and tongue height (formant F1), tongue front/back position and/or lip rounding (formant F2), and intensity/loudness.
Methods
Audiorecorded speech was obtained from 98 patients (including 25 with clinically rated aprosody and 29 without) and 102 unaffected controls using five tasks: one describing a drawing, two based on spontaneous speech elicited through a question (Tasks 2 and 3), and two based on reading prose excerpts (Tasks 4 and 5). We compared groups on variation in pitch (F0), formant F1 and F2, and intensity/loudness.
Results
Regarding pitch variation, patients with aprosody differed significantly from controls in Task 5 in both unadjusted tests and those adjusted for sociodemographics. For the standard deviation (SD) of F1, no significant differences were found in adjusted tests. Regarding SD of F2, patients with aprosody had lower values than controls in Task 3, 4, and 5. For variation in intensity/loudness, patients with aprosody had lower values than patients without aprosody and controls across the five tasks.
Conclusions
Findings could represent a step toward developing new methods for measuring and tracking the severity of this specific negative symptom using acoustic phonetic parameters; such work is relevant to other psychiatric and neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a human body part motion analysis based approach is proposed for depression analysis. Depression is a serious psychological disorder. The absence of an (automated) objective diagnostic aid for depression leads to a range of subjective biases in initial diagnosis and ongoing monitoring. Researchers in the affective computing community have approached the depression detection problem using facial dynamics and vocal prosody. Recent works in affective computing have shown the significance of body pose and motion in analysing the psychological state of a person. Inspired by these works, we explore a body parts motion based approach. Relative orientation and radius are computed for the body parts detected using the pictorial structures framework. A histogram of relative parts motion is computed. To analyse the motion on a holistic level, space-time interest points are computed and a bag of words framework is learnt. The two histograms are fused and a support vector machine classifier is trained. The experiments conducted on a clinical database, prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We compared clinical diagnosis of major depression with automatically measured facial actions and vocal prosody in patients undergoing treatment for depression. Manual FACS coding, active appearance modeling (AAM) and pitch extraction were used to measure facial and vocal expression. Classifiers using leave-one-out validation were SVM for FACS and for AAM and logistic regression for voice. Both face and voice demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with depression. Accuracy in detecting depression was 88\% for manual FACS and 79\% for AAM. Accuracy for vocal prosody was 79\%. These findings suggest the feasibility of automatic detection of depression, raise new issues in automated facial image analysis and machine learning, and have exciting implications for clinical theory and practice.},

Recent studies have used modern sentence and word embeddings to compute coherence metrics for spontaneous speech in schizophrenia. While clinical ratings always have a subjective element, computational linguistic methodology allows quantification of speech abnormalities. Clinical and empirical knowledge from psychiatry provide the theoretical and conceptual basis for modelling. Our study is an interdisciplinary attempt at improving coherence models in schizophrenia. Speech samples were obtained from healthy controls and patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and different severity of positive formal thought disorder. Interviews were transcribed and coherence metrics derived from different embeddings. One model found higher coherence metrics for controls than patients. All other models remained non-significant. More detailed analysis of the data motivates different approaches to improving coherence models in schizophrenia, e.g. by assessing referential abnormalities.},

Here, we present the first benchmark comparison of previously proposed coherence models for detecting symptoms of schizophrenia and evaluate their performance on a new dataset of recorded interviews between subjects and clinicians. We also present two alternative coherence metrics based on modern sentence embedding techniques that outperform the previous methods on our dataset. Lastly, we propose a novel computational model for reference incoherence based on ambiguous pronoun usage and show that it is a highly predictive feature on our data.

However, measuring incoherence has often been complex and subjective. We sought to validate an objective, intrinsically reliable, computational approach to quantifying speech incoherence. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy control volunteers were administered a variety of language tasks. The speech generated was transcribed and the coherence computed using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The discourse was also analyzed with a standard clinical measure of thought disorder. In word association and generation tasks LSA derived coherence scores were sensitive to differences between patients and controls, and correlated with clinical measures of thought disorder. In speech samples LSA could be used to localize where in sentence production incoherence occurs, predict levels of incoherence as well as whether discourse “belonged” to a patient or control. In conclusion, LSA can be used to assay disordered language production so as to both complement human clinical ratings as well as experimentally parse this incoherence in a theory-driven manner.},

Much of this work has focused on transcribed speech samples, while no work to our knowledge has examined referential cohesion in written narratives among ultra high risk (UHR) youth using Coh-Metrix, an automated analysis tool. In the present study, written narratives from 84 individuals (UHR=41, control=43) were examined. Referential cohesion variables and relationships with symptoms and relevant cognitive variables were also investigated. Findings reveal less word “stem” overlap in narratives produced by UHR youth compared to controls, and correlations with symptom domains and verbal learning. The present study highlights the potential usefulness of automated analysis of written narratives in identifying at-risk youth and these data provide critical information in better understanding the etiology of psychosis. As writing production is commonly elicited in educational contexts, markers of aberrant cohesion in writing represent significant potential for identifying youth who could benefit from further screening, and utilizing software that is easily accessible and free may provide utility in academic and clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Language and speech are the primary source of data for psychiatrists to diagnose and treat mental disorders. In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier – comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns – that had an 83\% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79\% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72\% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention. More broadly, automated linguistic analysis can be a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment across neuropsychiatry.},

Results indicated that emotions in Black faces were less accurately recognized than emotions in White faces; Black faces were more likely to be seen as angry even when they were not, compared to White faces; and boys’ misbehaviors were perceived as more hostile than those of White boys. Together, these results consistently suggest that racialized emotion-related perceptions may enter the classroom with preservice teachers.

Systematic, balanced designs are rare, and are comprised of adults viewing adults. The present study expands the questions of racialized emotion recognition accuracy and anger bias to the world of children. Findings that adults demonstrate either less emotion accuracy and/or greater anger bias for Black versus White children could potentially explain some of the large racialized disciplinary discrepancies in schools. To test whether racialized emotion recognition accuracy and anger bias toward children exists, we asked 178 prospective teachers to complete an emotion recognition task comprised of 72 children’s facial expressions depicting six emotions and divided equally by race (Black, White) and gender (female, male). We also assessed implicit bias via the child race Implicit Association Test and explicit bias via questionnaire. Multilevel modeling revealed nuanced racialized emotion recognition accuracy with a race by gender interaction, but clear racialized anger bias toward both Black boys and girls. Both Black boys and Black girls were falsely seen as angry more often than White boys and White girls. Higher levels of either implicit or explicit bias did not increase odds of Black children being victim to anger bias, but instead decreased odds that White children would be misperceived as angry.

Surprisingly, little is known about diminished expression. The present study sought to address this issue by evaluating a commercially-available computerized facial analysis software for understanding diminished expressivity. We analyzed natural facial expression from a series of laboratory interaction tasks in 28 individuals with psychometric schizotypy - defined as the personality organization reflecting a putative genetic schizophrenia liability, and 26 matched controls. We evaluated (a) feasibility - defined in terms of the number of video frames recognized by the software, (b) reliability - defined in terms of correlations between facial expression variables across the three laboratory interactions, and (c) construct validity - defined in terms of relationships to clinical variables. For most subjects ({\textasciitilde}80\%), approximately three-quarters of the video frames were analyzable by the software; however, a minority of the videos were essentially unreadable. The facial expression variables showed excellent reliability across interaction conditions. In terms of construct validity, facial expression variables were significantly related to a measure of psychoticism, tapping subjective cognitive concerns and "first-rank" schizophrenia symptoms, but were generally not different between groups. Facial expression variables were generally not significantly related to measures of depression, anxiety, paranoia or, surprisingly, self-reported negative schizotypy. While computerized facial analysis appears to be a reliable and promising method of understanding diminished expressivity across the schizophrenia-spectrum, some work remains.

Unlike facial expression ratings based on categorization of expressions into prototypical emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, etc.), FACS can encode ambiguous and subtle expressions, and therefore is potentially more suitable for analyzing the small differences in facial affect. However, FACS rating requires extensive training, and is time consuming and subjective thus prone to bias. To overcome these limitations, we developed an automated FACS based on advanced computer science technology. The system automatically tracks faces in a video, extracts geometric and texture features, and produces temporal profiles of each facial muscle movement. These profiles are quantified to compute frequencies of single and combined Action Units (AUs) in videos, and they can facilitate a statistical study of large populations in disorders known to impact facial expression. We derived quantitative measures of flat and inappropriate facial affect automatically from temporal AU profiles. Applicability of the automated FACS was illustrated in a pilot study, by applying it to data of videos from eight schizophrenia patients and controls. We created temporal AU profiles that provided rich information on the dynamics of facial muscle movements for each subject. The quantitative measures of flatness and inappropriateness showed clear differences between patients and the controls, highlighting their potential in automatic and objective quantification of symptom severity.},

In this paper, we present an automated system that we developed to recognize facial gestures in static, frontal- and/or profile-view color face images. A multidetector approach to facial feature localization is utilized to spatially sample the profile contour and the contours of the facial components such as the eyes and the mouth. From the extracted contours of the facial features, we extract ten profile-contour fiducial points and 19 fiducial points of the contours of the facial components. Based on these, 32 individual facial muscle actions (AUs) occurring alone or in combination are recognized using rule-based reasoning. With each scored AU, the utilized algorithm associates a factor denoting the certainty with which the pertinent AU has been scored. A recognition rate of 86\% is achieved.},

	abstract = {Negative symptoms, such as blunted facial affect, are core features of psychotic disorders that predict poor functional outcome. However, it is unknown whether these impairments occur prior to the onset of psychosis. Understanding this phenomenon in the psychosis risk period has significant relevance for elucidating pathogenic processes, as well as potential for informing a viable new behavioral marker for broader social dysfunction and clinical course. The current study sought to determine the nature of facial expression deficits among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for developing psychosis using a comprehensive approach, incorporating clinical interview ratings and automated facial expression coding analysis. A total of 42 CHR and 42 control participants completed clinical interviews and digitally taped segments were submitted into an automated, computerized tool to assess for seven basic facial expressions (joy, anger, surprise, fear, contempt, disgust, sadness). Furthermore, relationships between facial expressions and social functioning and available scores on a psychosis conversion risk calculator from a total of 78 participants (39 CHR and 39 controls) were examined. Relationships between measures were also investigated (data was available for the Prodromal Inventory of Negative Symptoms among 33 CHR and 25 controls). Findings from clinical interview indicated that the CHR group exhibited elevated blunting. Furthermore, automated analyses showed that the CHR group displayed blunting in expressions of joy but surprisingly, increased anger facial expressions. Lastly, irregularities in facial expressions were related to decreased social functioning and increased psychosis conversion risk calculator scores, signaling heightened likelihood of conversion to psychosis. These findings suggest that alterations in facial expressivity occur early in the pathogenesis of psychosis and provide evidence for the efficacy of higher resolution measures of facial expressivity in psychosis research.},

The state of the art witnesses how technology, and in particular robotics, may offer promising tools to strengthen the research and therapy of ASD. This work represents the ﬁrst attempt to use machine-learning strategies during robot-ASD children interactions, in terms of facial expression imitation, making possible an objective evaluation of children’s behaviours and then giving the possibility to introduce a metric about the effectiveness of the therapy. In particular, the work focuses on the basic emotion recognition skills. In addition to the aforementioned applicative innovations this work contributes also to introduce a facial expression recognition (FER) engine that automatically detects and tracks the child’s face and then recognize emotions on the basis of a machine learning pipeline based on HOG descriptor and Support Vector Machines. Two different experimental sessions were carried out: the ﬁrst one tested the FER engine on publicly available datasets demonstrating that the proposed pipeline outperforms the existing strategies in terms of recognition accuracy. The second one involved ASD children and it was a preliminary exploration of how the introduction of the FER engine in the therapeutic protocol can be effectively used to monitor children’s behaviours.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the influence of demographics on the performance of face recognition algorithms. The recognition accuracies of six different face recognition algorithms (three commercial, two nontrainable, and one trainable) are computed on a large scale gallery that is partitioned so that each partition consists entirely of specific demographic cohorts. Eight total cohorts are isolated based on gender (male and female), race/ethnicity (Black, White, and Hispanic), and age group (18-30, 30-50, and 50-70 years old). Experimental results demonstrate that both commercial and the nontrainable algorithms consistently have lower matching accuracies on the same cohorts (females, Blacks, and age group 18-30) than the remaining cohorts within their demographic. Additional experiments investigate the impact of the demographic distribution in the training set on the performance of a trainable face recognition algorithm. We show that the matching accuracy for race/ethnicity and age cohorts can be improved by training exclusively on that specific cohort. Operationally, this leads to a scenario, called dynamic face matcher selection, where multiple face recognition algorithms (each trained on different demographic cohorts) are available for a biometric system operator to select based on the demographic information extracted from a probe image. This procedure should lead to improved face recognition accuracy in many intelligence and law enforcement face recognition scenarios. Finally, we show that an alternative to dynamic face matcher selection is to train face recognition algorithms on datasets that are evenly distributed across demographics, as this approach offers consistently high accuracy across all cohorts.},

	abstract = {The practical applications of artificial intelligence are expanding into various elements of society, leading to a growing interest in the potential biases of such algorithms. Facial analysis, one application of artificial intelligence, is increasingly used in real-word situations. For example, some organizations tell candidates to answer predefined questions in a recorded video and use facial recognition to analyze the potential applicant faces. In addition, some companies are developing facial recognition software to scan the faces in crowds and assess threats, specifically mentioning doubt and anger as emotions that indicate threats.  This study provides evidence that facial recognition software interprets emotions differently based on the person’s race. Using a publically available data set of professional basketball players’ pictures, I compare the emotional analysis from two different facial recognition services, Face   and Microsoft's Face API. Both services interpret black players as having more negative emotions than white players; however, there are two different mechanisms. Face   consistently interprets black players as angrier than white players, even controlling for their degree of smiling. Microsoft registers contempt instead of anger, and it interprets black players as more contemptuous when their facial expressions are ambiguous. As the players’ smile widens, the disparity disappears. This finding has implications for individuals, organizations, and society, and it contributes to the growing literature of bias and/or disparate impact in AI.},

Such methodologies allow for the rapid and objective measurement of language features, many of which are not easily recognized by human raters.

Future directions in extended CHR networks include studies of sources of variance, and combination with other promising biomarkers of psychosis risk, such as cognitive and sensory processing impairments likely to be related to language.

Over the last several years, the quality of these systems has dramatically improved, due both to advances in deep learning and to the collection of large-scale datasets used to train the systems. There is concern, however, that these tools do not work equally well for all subgroups of the population. Here, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art ASR systems—developed by Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft—to transcribe structured interviews conducted with 42 white speakers and 73 black speakers. In total, this corpus spans five US cities and consists of 19.8 h of audio matched on the age and gender of the speaker. We found that all five ASR systems exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers. We trace these disparities to the underlying acoustic models used by the ASR systems as the race gap was equally large on a subset of identical phrases spoken by black and white individuals in our corpus. We conclude by proposing strategies—such as using more diverse training datasets that include African American Vernacular English—to reduce these performance differences and ensure speech recognition technology is inclusive.},

	abstract = {Background
              Formal thought disorder is a cardinal feature of psychosis. However, the extent to which formal thought disorder is evident in ultra-high-risk individuals and whether it is linked to the progression to psychosis remains unclear.
            
            
              Aims
              Examine the severity of formal thought disorder in ultra-high-risk participants and its association with future psychosis.
            
            
              Method
              The Thought and Language Index (TLI) was used to assess 24 ultra-high-risk participants, 16 people with first-episode psychosis and 13 healthy controls. Ultra-high-risk individuals were followed up for a mean duration of 7 years (s.d.=1.5) to determine the relationship between formal thought disorder at baseline and transition to psychosis.
            
            
              Results
              TLI scores were significantly greater in the ultra-high-risk group compared with the healthy control group (effect size (ES)=1.2), but lower than in people with first-episode psychosis (ES=0.8). Total and negative TLI scores were higher in ultra-high-risk individuals who developed psychosis, but this was not significant. Combining negative TLI scores with attenuated psychotic symptoms and basic symptoms predicted transition to psychosis (P=0.04; ES=1.04).
            
            
              Conclusions
              TLI is beneficial in evaluating formal thought disorder in ultra-high-risk participants, and complements existing instruments for the evaluation of psychopathology in this group.},

	abstract = {Negative symptoms, such as blunted facial affect, are core features of psychotic disorders that predict poor functional outcome. However, it is unknown whether these impairments occur prior to the onset of psychosis. Understanding this phenomenon in the psychosis risk period has significant relevance for elucidating pathogenic processes, as well as potential for informing a viable new behavioral marker for broader social dysfunction and clinical course. The current study sought to determine the nature of facial expression deficits among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for developing psychosis using a comprehensive approach, incorporating clinical interview ratings and automated facial expression coding analysis. A total of 42 CHR and 42 control participants completed clinical interviews and digitally taped segments were submitted into an automated, computerized tool to assess for seven basic facial expressions (joy, anger, surprise, fear, contempt, disgust, sadness). Furthermore, relationships between facial expressions and social functioning and available scores on a psychosis conversion risk calculator from a total of 78 participants (39 CHR and 39 controls) were examined. Relationships between measures were also investigated (data was available for the Prodromal Inventory of Negative Symptoms among 33 CHR and 25 controls). Findings from clinical interview indicated that the CHR group exhibited elevated blunting. Furthermore, automated analyses showed that the CHR group displayed blunting in expressions of joy but surprisingly, increased anger facial expressions. Lastly, irregularities in facial expressions were related to decreased social functioning and increased psychosis conversion risk calculator scores, signaling heightened likelihood of conversion to psychosis. These findings suggest that alterations in facial expressivity occur early in the pathogenesis of psychosis and provide evidence for the efficacy of higher resolution measures of facial expressivity in psychosis research.},

As yet, our treatments for negative symptoms are palliative at best and our understanding of their causes is relatively superficial. To address this, we are developing objective ambulatory tools for digitally phenotyping their severity which can be used outside the confines of the traditional clinical and research settings. The present study evaluated the feasibility, reliability and validity of ambulatory vocal acoustic and facial emotion expression analysis. Videos were provided by 25 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 27 nonpsychiatric controls using inexpensive, non-invasive ambulatory recording methods. Controls provided 411 video recordings, and patients provided 377 video recordings; an average of 15.22 and 14.50 per participant per group respectively. The vast majority (over 80\%) of these videos were usable for analysis. An empirically-supported, limited-feature vocal (7 features) and facial (3 features) set was examined. Within participants, these features varied considerably over time, but showed moderate to good test-retest reliability in many cases once contextual factors (e.g., activity involved in at the time of testing) were accounted for. Vocal and facial features showed statistically significant convergence with a “gold standard” negative symptom measure. Ambulatory vocal/facial features were more strongly associated with engagement in social or work activities in patients than negative symptom ratings. These data support the use of ambulatory vocal/facial analytic technologies for digital phenotyping of these negative symptoms.},

Available clinical facial expression evaluations provide subjective and qualitative measurements, which are based on static 2D images that do not capture the temporal dynamics and subtleties of expression changes. Therefore, there is a need for automated, objective and quantitative measurements of facial expressions captured using videos. This paper presents a computational framework that creates probabilistic expression profiles for video data and can potentially help to automatically quantify emotional expression differences between patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy controls. Our method automatically detects and tracks facial landmarks in videos, and then extracts geometric features to characterize facial expression changes. To analyze temporal facial expression changes, we employ probabilistic classifiers that analyze facial expressions in individual frames, and then propagate the probabilities throughout the video to capture the temporal characteristics of facial expressions. The applications of our method to healthy controls and case studies of patients with schizophrenia and Asperger's syndrome demonstrate the capability of the video-based expression analysis method in capturing subtleties of facial expression. Such results can pave the way for a video-based method for quantitative analysis of facial expressions in clinical research of disorders that cause affective deficits.},

	abstract = {In schizophrenia, nonverbal behavior, including body movement, is of theoretical and clinical importance. Although reduced nonverbal expressiveness is a major component of the negative symptoms encountered in schizophrenia, few studies have objectively assessed body movement during social interaction. In the present study, 378 brief, videotaped role-play scenes involving 27 stabilized outpatients diagnosed with paranoid-type schizophrenia were analyzed using Motion Energy Analysis (MEA). This method enables the objective measuring of body movement in conjunction with ordinary video recordings. Correlations between movement parameters (percentage of time in movement, movement speed) and symptom ratings from independent PANSS interviews were calculated. Movement parameters proved to be highly reliable. In keeping with predictions, reduced movement and movement speed correlated with negative symptoms. Accordingly, in patients who exhibited noticeable movement for less than 20\% of the observation time, prominent negative symptoms were highly probable. As a control measure, the percentage of movement exhibited by the patients during role-play scenes was compared to that of their normal interactants. Patients with negative symptoms differed from normal interactants by showing significantly reduced head and body movement. Two specific positive symptoms were possibly related to movement parameters: suspiciousness tended to correlate with reduced head movement, and the expression of unusual thought content tended to relate to increased movement. Overall, a close and theoretically meaningful association between the objective movement parameters and the symptom profiles was found. MEA appears to be an objective, reliable and valid method for quantifying nonverbal behavior, an aspect which may furnish new insights into the processes related to reduced expressiveness in schizophrenia.},

This paper presents the development and validation of a computational framework for quantifying emotional expression differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Each face is modeled as a combination of elastic regions, and expression changes are modeled as a deformation between a neutral face and an expressive face. Functions of these deformations, known as the regional volumetric difference (RVD) functions, form distinctive quantitative profiles of expressions. Employing pattern classification techniques, we have designed expression classifiers for the four universal emotions of happiness, sadness, anger and fear by training on RVD functions of expression changes. The classifiers were cross-validated and then applied to facial expression images of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The classification score for each image reflects the extent to which the expressed emotion matches the intended emotion. Group-wise statistical analysis revealed this score to be significantly different between healthy controls and patients, especially in the case of anger. This score correlated with clinical severity of flat affect. These results encourage the use of such deformation based expression quantification measures for research in clinical applications that require the automated measurement of facial affect.},

Assessment of such subtle aspects of thought disorders has proved to be a challenging task in clinical practice and to date no surrogate markers exist that can reliably track the physiological eﬀects of treatments that could reduce thought disorders. Recently, automated speech graph analysis has emerged as a promising means to reliably quantify structural speech disorganization. Methods: Using structural and functional imaging, we investigated the neural basis and the functional relevance of the structural connectedness of speech samples obtained from 56 patients with psychosis (22 with bipolar disorder, 34 with schizophrenia). Speech structure was assessed by non-semantic graph analysis. Results: We found a canonical correlation linking speech connectedness and i) functional as well as developmentally relevant structural brain markers (degree centrality from resting state functional imaging and cortical gyriﬁcation index) ii) psychometric evaluation of thought disorder iii) aspects of cognitive performance (processing speed deﬁcits) and iv) functional outcome in patients. Of various clinical metrics, only speech connectedness was correlated with biological markers. Speech connectedness ﬁlled the dynamic range of responses better than psychometric measurements of thought disorder. Conclusions: The results provide novel evidence that speech dysconnectivity could emerge from neurodevelopmental deﬁcits and associated dysconnectivity in psychosis.},

This analysis relies mostly on connectedness, a structural feature of speech that is anti-correlated with negative symptoms. Here we aimed to verify whether speech disorganization during the first clinical contact, as measured by graph connectedness, can correctly classify negative symptoms and the schizophrenia diagnosis 6 months in advance. Positive and negative syndrome scale scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients undergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis, followed for 6 months to establish diagnosis, and compared to 21 well-matched healthy subjects. Each report was represented as a word-trajectory graph. Connectedness was measured by number of edges, number of nodes in the largest connected component and number of nodes in the largest strongly connected component. Similarities to random graphs were estimated. All connectedness attributes were combined into a single Disorganization Index weighted by the correlation with the positive and negative syndrome scale negative subscale, and used for classifications. Random-like connectedness was more prevalent among schizophrenia patients (64 × 5\% in Control group, p = 0.0002). Connectedness from two kinds of memory reports (dream and negative image) explained 88\% of negative symptoms variance (p {\textless} 0.0001). The Disorganization Index classified low vs. high severity of negative symptoms with 100\% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 1), and schizophrenia diagnosis with 91.67\% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85). The index was validated in an independent cohort of chronic psychotic patients and controls (N = 60) (85\% accuracy). Thus, speech disorganization during the first clinical contact correlates tightly with negative symptoms, and is quite discriminative of the schizophrenia diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Early psychiatry investigated dreams to understand psychopathologies. Contemporary psychiatry, which neglects dreams, has been criticized for lack of objectivity. In search of quantitative insight into the structure of psychotic speech, we investigated speech graph attributes (SGA) in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder type I and non-psychotic controls as they reported waking and dream contents. Schizophrenic subjects spoke with reduced connectivity, in tight correlation with negative and cognitive symptoms measured by standard psychometric scales. Bipolar and control subjects were undistinguishable by waking reports, but in dream reports bipolar subjects showed significantly less connectivity. Dream-related SGA outperformed psychometric scores or waking-related data for group sorting. Altogether, the results indicate that online and offline processing, the two most fundamental modes of brain operation, produce nearly opposite effects on recollections: While dreaming exposes differences in the mnemonic records across individuals, waking dampens distinctions. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of the differential diagnosis of psychosis based on the analysis of dream graphs, pointing to a fast, low-cost and language-invariant tool for psychiatric diagnosis and the objective search for biomarkers. The Freudian notion that “dreams are the royal road to the unconscious” is clinically useful, after all.},

Specifically, models examining psychotic patients (Hedges’ g =.96, p=.003) and those with autism (Hedges’ g = .84, p {\textless}.0001) were highly effective. Our results show semantic space models are effective as a diagnostic tool in a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders.

This study aimed at 1) reviewing the literature on the neural correlates of FTD in schizophrenia, and 2) testing the hypothesis that FTD correlates with structural and functional aberrations in the language network. Medline, PsychInfo, and Embase were searched for neuroimaging studies, which applied a clinical measure to assess FTD in adults with schizophrenia and were published in English or German in peer-reviewed journals until December 2016. Of 412 articles identified, 61 studies were included in the review. Volumetric studies reported bilateral grey matter deficits (L {\textgreater} R) to be associated with FTD in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobe. The same regions showed hyperactivity in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies and both hyper- and hypoactivity in fMRI studies that employed semantic processing or free speech production tasks. Diffusion tensor imaging studies demonstrated white matter aberrations in fibre tracts that connect the frontal and temporo-parietal regions. FTD in schizophrenia was found to be associated with structural and functional aberrations in the language network. However, there are studies that did not find an association between FTD and neural aberrations of the language network and regions not included in the language network have been associated with FTD. Thus, future research is needed to clarify the specificity of the language network for FTD in schizophrenia.},

For this purpose we used the Assessment Battery of Communication (ABaCo; Sacco et al., 2008). The ABaCo is a validated clinical tool for assessing pragmatic skills, which comprises five evaluation scales—linguistic, extralinguistic, paralinguistic, context, and conversational—investigating both comprehension and production of the main pragmatic phenomena involved in a communicative exchange, such as direct and indirect speech acts, irony, deceit, the violation of Grice's maxims, topic management, and turn-taking. The battery was administered to a group of seventeen patients with schizophrenia, and matched healthy controls. We expected the clinical group to perform widely worse than the control group in the different pragmatic dimensions investigated. Results showed that patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than controls on all the five scales of the battery, both in comprehension and production tasks. Moreover, the results within each scale showed a differentiated performance in the clinical group among the pragmatic phenomena, with irony assessed as the most difficult task. The implications of these results for research and treatment in schizophrenia are discussed. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will be able to: (1) summarize thepreliminary assessment of pragmatic impairments in patients with schizophrenia; (2) describea variegated communicative profile regarding different pragmatic phenomena; and (3) discuss the planning and evaluating specific rehabilitation programs.},

Based on these findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing "bias" in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of "bias"---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements---and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.},

Potosí was the destination of massive migration during its economic heydays around 1610 and one of the largest cities in the Western hemisphere at the time. In the mines special codes were developed, with a specialized lexicon that contains words from different languages. This lexicon was so different that the first vocabulary of the mining language was written in 1610, and many have followed from that date onward. Quechua most probably played a key role as intermediary language between two forms of speaking: the indigenous mining language of the free workers, yanaconas and mingas , probably a mix of Spanish and Quechua, and the language of the forced workers, mitayos , possibly a mix of Aymara and Quechua. The similarities between Aymara and Quechua must have contributed to this possibility of an intermediary language.},

Thus the process of borrowing morphology is far from uniform. Rather, it reflects the complexity of all language contact processes, in which the four dimensions listed play a role.},

The present work was designed to (a) determine the generalizability of such a decline by comparing adult English, adult Salish, and English infant subjects on their perception of a new non-English (Salish) speech contrast, and (b) delineate the time course of the developmental decline in this ability. The results of these experiments replicate our original findings by showing that infants can discriminate nonnative speech contrasts without relevant experience, and that there is a decline in this ability during ontogeny. Furthermore, data from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies shows that this decline occurs within the first year of life, and that it is a function of specific language experience.},

	title = {The {Emergence} of the {Speech} {Capacity}},
	isbn = {978-1-4106-0256-5},
	abstract = {Recent studies of vocal development in infants have shed new light on old questions of how the speech capacity is founded and how it may have evolved in the human species. Vocalizations in the very first months of life appear to provide previously unrecognized clues to the earliest steps in the process by which language came to exist and the processes by which communicative disorders arise.  Perhaps the most interesting sounds made by infants are the uniquely human 'protophones' (loosely, 'babbling'), the precursors to speech. Kimbrough Oller argues that these are most profitably interpreted in the context of a new infrastructural model of speech. The model details the manner in which well-formed speech units are constructed, and it reveals how infant vocalizations mature through the first months of life by increasingly adhering to the rules of well-formed speech.   He lays out many advantages of an infrastructural approach. Infrastructural interpretation illuminates the significance of vocal stages, and highlights clinically significant deviations, such as the previously unnoticed delays in vocal development that occur in deaf infants. An infrastructural approach also specifies potential paths of evolution for vocal communicative systems. Infrastructural properties and principles of potential communicative systems prove to be organized according to a natural logic--some properties and principles naturally presuppose others. Consequently some paths of evolution are likely while others can be ruled out. An infrastructural analysis also provides a stable basis for comparisons across species, comparisons that show how human vocal capabilities outstrip those of their primate relatives even during the first months of human infancy.  The Emergence of the Speech Capacity will challenge psychologists, linguists, speech pathologists, and primatologists alike to rethink the ways they categorize and describe communication. Oller's infraphonological model permits provocative reconceptualizations of the ways infant vocalizations progress systematically toward speech, insightful comparisons between speech and the vocal systems of other species, and fruitful speculations about the origins of language.},

Moreover, the well-rehearsed sounds from babble serve as a perceptual ‘filter’, drawing infants’ attention towards words that match the sounds they can reliably produce. Using naturalistic home recordings of 44 10–11-month-olds (an age with high variability in early speech sound production), this study tests whether infants’ early consonant productions match words and objects in their environment. We find that infants’ babble matches the consonants produced in their caregivers’ speech. Infants with a well-established consonant repertoire also match their babble to objects in their environment. Our findings show that infants’ early consonant productions are shaped by their input: by 10 months, the sounds of babble match what infants see and hear.},

Infant-worn recorders were used to collect day-long audio recordings, and infant speech-related and adult vocalisation onsets and offsets were automatically identified. We examined vocalisation-to-vocalisation steps, focusing on inter-vocalisation time intervals and distances in an acoustic space defined by mean pitch and mean amplitude, measured from the child’s perspective. Infant inter-vocalisation intervals were shorter immediately following a vocal response from an adult. Adult intervals were shorter following an infant response and adult inter-vocalisation pitch differences were smaller following the receipt of a vocal response from the infant. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that infants and caregivers are foraging vocally for social input. Increasing infant age was associated with changes in inter-vocalisation step sizes for both infants and adults, and we found associations between response likelihood and acoustic characteristics. Future work is needed to determine the impact of different labelling methods and of automatic labelling errors on the results. The study represents a novel application of foraging theory, demonstrating how infant behaviour and infant-caregiver interaction can be characterised as foraging processes.},

Infant-friendly wearable audio recorders can now capture very large quantities of these sounds throughout infants’ everyday lives at home. Here, we review recent discoveries about how infants’ soundscapes are organized over the course of a day. Analyses designed to detect patterns in infants’ daylong audio at multiple timescales have revealed that everyday vocalizations are clustered hierarchically in time, that vocal explorations are consistent with foraging dynamics, and that some musical tunes occur for much longer cumulative durations than others. This approach focusing on the multiscale distributions of sounds heard and produced by infants is providing new, fundamental insights on human communication development from a complex-systems perspective.},

We found that an adult was more likely to respond when the child’s vocalization was speech related rather than not speech related. In turn, a child’s vocalization was more likely to be speech related if the child’s previous speech-related vocalization had received an immediate adult response rather than no response. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that there is a social feedback loop between child and caregiver that promotes speech development. Although this feedback loop applies in both typical development and autism, children with autism produced proportionally fewer speech-related vocalizations, and the responses they received were less contingent on whether their vocalizations were speech related.

	abstract = {Human infant vocalization is viewed as a critical foundation for vocal learning and language. All apes share distress sounds (shrieks and cries) and laughter. Another vocal type, speech-like sounds, common in human infants, is rare but not absent in other apes. These three vocal types form a basis for especially informative cross-species comparisons. To make such comparisons possible we need empirical research documenting the frequency of occurrence of all three. The present work provides a comprehensive portrayal of these three vocal types in the human infant from longitudinal research in various circumstances of recording. Recently, the predominant vocalizations of the human infant have been shown to be speech-like sounds, or ‘protophones’, including both canonical and non-canonical babbling. The research shows that protophones outnumber cries by a factor of at least five based on data from random-sampling of all-day recordings across the first year. The present work expands on the prior reports, showing the protophones vastly outnumber both cry and laughter in both all-day and laboratory recordings in various circumstances. The data provide new evidence of the predominance of protophones in the infant vocal landscape and illuminate their role in human vocal learning and the origin of language.

	abstract = {Infants perceptually tune to the phonemes of their native languages in the first year of life, thereby losing the ability to discriminate non-native phonemes. Infants who perceptually tune earlier have been shown to develop stronger language skills later in childhood. We hypothesized that socioeconomic disparities, which have been associated with differences in the quality and quantity of language in the home, would contribute to individual differences in phonetic discrimination. Seventy-five infants were assessed on measures of phonetic discrimination at 9 months, on the quality of the home environment at 15 months, and on language abilities at both ages. Phonetic discrimination did not vary according to socioeconomic status (SES), but was significantly associated with the quality of the home environment. This association persisted when controlling for 9-month expressive language abilities, rendering it less likely that infants with better expressive language skills were simply engendering higher quality home interactions. This suggests that infants from linguistically richer home environments may be more tuned to their native language and therefore less able to discriminate non-native contrasts at 9 months relative to infants whose home environments are less responsive. These findings indicate that home language environments may be more critical than SES in contributing to early language perception, with possible implications for language development more broadly.},

              We examined associations between vocal communication with canonical syllables and expressive language and then examined 2 potential alternative explanations for such associations.
            
            
              Method
              
                Specifically, we tested whether the associations remained when excluding canonical syllables in identifiable words and controlling for the number of communication acts. Participants included 68 preverbal or low verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (

              Results
              
                Vocal communication with canonical syllables and expressive language were concurrently and longitudinally associated with moderate to strong (

              Conclusions
              The findings provide increased support for measuring vocal communication with canonical syllables and for examining a causal relation between vocal communication with canonical syllables and expressive language in children with ASD who are preverbal or low verbal. In future studies, it may be unnecessary to eliminate identifiable words when measuring vocal communication in this population. Following replication, vocal communication with canonical syllables may be considered when making intervention- planning decisions.},

Babbling and pointing did not develop in tight synchrony and babble onset alone predicted first words. Pointing and maternal education emerged as predictors of lexical knowledge only in relation to a measure taken at 18 months. This suggests a far more important role for early phonological development in the creation of the lexicon than previously thought.},

A simple screening procedure that focuses on canonical babbling was used to evaluate over 3400 infants at risk who were about 10 months of age. Among infants who showed late onset of canonical babbling, fewer than half had been previously diagnosed as having a significant medical problem that might have accounted for the delay. A follow-up study indicated that infants with delayed canonical babbling had smaller production vocabularies at 18, 24, and 30 months than did infants in the control group.

	abstract = {Introduction
Canonical babbling ratio (CBR) is a commonly used measure to quantify canonical babbling (CB), and 0.15 is the commonly accepted criterion for the canonical babbling stage. However, this has not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of this criterion using concurrent and predictive comparisons.
Methods
Longitudinal data from 50 children recruited in different clinical projects were used. At 10 months of age, CBR was calculated based on counted utterances from audio-video recorded parent-child interactions. The videos were also assessed by CB observation, where an observer made an overall judgement on whether the child was in the canonical babbling stage or not. For the concurrent evaluation, CBR was compared to CB observation as a reference test, using area under the curve (AUC). The criterion resulting in the best combination of sensitivity and specificity was identified using positive likelihood ratios. In the predictive comparisons CBR was analyzed as a predictor of speech/language difficulties at 30–36 months. Participants presenting with difficulties in consonant production and/or parent-reported vocabulary were considered to have speech/language difficulties. Sensitivity and specificity were compared for CBR using the 0.15 criterion and the new criterion identified in this study.
Results
An AUC of 0.87 indicated that CBR is a valid measure of canonical babbling in 10-month-old children. The best combination of sensitivity and specificity was found at a criterion of 0.14 (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.70). In the predictive comparison, CBR with a 0.14 or 0.15 criterion revealed the same sensitivity (0.71) but 0.14 showed a slightly better specificity (0.52 versus 0.42).
Conclusions
CBR is a valid measure of CB (at 10 months). However, when using CBR to classify children's babbling as canonical or non-canonical, researchers need to carefully consider the implications of the chosen criterion.},

	abstract = {Theories of language acquisition have highlighted the importance of adult speakers as active participants in children’s language learning. However, in many communities children are reported to be directly engaged by their caregivers only rarely (Lieven, 1994). This observation raises the possibility that these children learn language from observing, rather than participating in, communicative exchanges. In this paper, we quantify naturally occurring language input in one community where directed interaction with children has been reported to be rare (Yucatec Mayan). We compare this input to the input heard by children growing up in large families in the United States, and we consider how directed and overheard input relate to Mayan children’s later vocabulary. In Study 1, we demonstrate that 1-year-old Mayan children do indeed hear a smaller proportion of total input in directed speech than children from the US. In Study 2, we show that for Mayan (but not US) children, there are great increases in the proportion of directed input that children receive between 13 and 35 months. In Study 3, we explore the validity of using videotaped data in a Mayan village. In Study 4, we demonstrate that word types directed to Mayan children from adults at 24 months (but not word types overheard by children or word types directed from other children) predict later vocabulary. These findings suggest that adult talk directed to children is important for early word learning, even in communities where much of children’s early language input comes from overheard speech.

All-day recordings of parent-infant interactions at home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants? language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate language growth.},

We investigate the daylong language environments of children (0;0–3;0) on Rossel Island, Papua New Guinea, a small-scale traditional community where prior ethnographic study demonstrated contingency-seeking child interaction styles. In fact, children were infrequently directly addressed and linguistic input rate was primarily affected by situational factors, though children’s vocalization maturity showed no developmental delay. We compare the input characteristics between this community and a Tseltal Mayan one in which near-parallel methods produced comparable results, then briefly discuss the models and mechanisms for learning best supported by our findings.},

Analyses of systematic daytime behavioral observations reveal {\textless} 1 min per daylight hour is spent talking to children younger than 4 years of age, which is 4 times less than estimates for others present at the same time and place. Adults provide a majority of the input at 0–3 years of age but not afterward. When integrated with previous work, these results reveal large cross-cultural variation in the linguistic experiences provided to young children. Consideration of more diverse human populations is necessary to build generalizable theories of language acquisition.},

Children were infrequently directly spoken to, with most directed speech coming from adults, and no increase with age. Most directed speech came in the mornings, and interactional peaks contained nearly four times the baseline rate of directed speech. Coarse indicators of children’s language development (babbling, first words, first word combinations) suggest that Tseltal children manage to extract the linguistic information they need despite minimal directed speech. Multiple proposals for how they might do so are discussed.},

Focusing on speaker gender, age, and addressee in randomly selected clips from each recording the results revealed that speech quantity to children was remarkably stable across age and child-directed speech primarily comes from women.

	abstract = {To determine whether late onset of canonical babbling could be used as a criterion to determine risk of hearing impairment, we obtained vocalization samples longitudinally from 94 infants with normal hearing and 37 infants with severe to profound hearing impairment. Parents were instructed to report the onset of canonical babbling (the production of well-formed syllables such as "da," "na," "bee," "yaya"). Verification that the infants were producing canonical syllables was collected in laboratory audio recordings. Infants with normal hearing produced canonical vocalizations before 11 months of age (range, 3 to 10 months; mode, 7 months); infants who were deaf failed to produce canonical syllables until 11 months of age or older, often well into the third year of life (range, 11 to 49 months; mode, 24 months). The correlation between age at onset of the canonical stage and age at auditory amplification was 0.68, indicating that early identification and fitting of hearing aids is of significant benefit to infants learning language. The fact that there is no overlap in the distribution of the onset of canonical babbling between infants with normal hearing and infants with hearing impairment means that the failure of otherwise healthy infants to produce canonical syllables before 11 months of age should be considered a serious risk factor for hearing impairment and, when observed, should result in immediate referral for audiologic evaluation.

	abstract = {What is the social function of babbling? An important function of prelinguistic vocalizing may be to elicit parental behavior in ways that facilitate the infant's own learning about speech and language. Infants use parental feedback to their babbling to learn new vocal forms, but the microstructure of parental responses to babbling has not been studied. To enable precise manipulation of the proximal infant cues that may influence maternal behavior, we used a playback paradigm to assess mothers’ responsiveness to prerecorded audiovisual clips of unfamiliar infants’ noncry prelinguistic vocalizations and actions. Acoustic characteristics and directedness of vocalizations were manipulated to test their efficacy in structuring social interactions. We also compared maternal responsiveness in the playback paradigm and in free play with their own infants. Maternal patterns of reactions to babbling were stable across both tasks. In the playback task, we found specific vocal cues, such as the degree of resonance and the transition timing of consonant-vowel syllables, predicted contingent maternal responding. Vocalizations directed at objects also facilitated increased responsiveness. The responses mothers exhibited, such as sensitive speech and vocal imitation, are known to facilitate vocal learning and development. Infants, by influencing the behavior of their caregivers with their babbling, create social interactions that facilitate their own communicative development.},

	abstract = {How did vocal language originate? Before trying to determine how referential vocabulary or syntax may have arisen, it is critical to explain how ancient hominins began to produce vocalization flexibly, without binding to emotions or functions. A crucial factor in the vocal communicative split of hominins from the ape background may thus have been copious, functionally flexible vocalization, starting in infancy and continuing throughout life, long before there were more advanced linguistic features such as referential vocabulary. 2–3 month-old modern human infants produce “protophones”, including at least three types of functionally flexible non-cry precursors to speech rarely reported in other ape infants. But how early in life do protophones actually appear? We report that the most common protophone types emerge abundantly as early as vocalization can be observed in infancy, in preterm infants still in neonatal intensive care. Contrary to the expectation that cries are the predominant vocalizations of infancy, our all-day recordings showed that protophones occurred far more frequently than cries in both preterm and full-term infants. Protophones were not limited to interactive circumstances, but also occurred at high rates when infants were alone, indicating an endogenous inclination to vocalize exploratorily, perhaps the most fundamental capacity underlying vocal language.},

Method: A longitudinal design was used, combining both naturalistic observations and a nonword repetition test. Fifteen 26-month-olds (12 of whom were followed from age 11 months) were administered a nonword test including real words, “standard” nonwords (identical for all children), and nonwords based on individual children’s production inventory (IN and OUT words).
Results: A strong relationship was found between (a) length of experience with consonant production and (b) nonword repetition and between (a) differential experience with specific consonants through production and (b) performance on the IN versus OUT words.
Conclusions: Performance depended on familiarity with words or their subunits and was strongest for real words, weaker for IN words, and weakest for OUT words. The results demonstrate the important role of speech production in the construction of phonological working memory.},

The classic proponent of the discontinuity school is Jakobson 1941/1968, who claimed that the pairing of sound and meaning drastically alters the child's sound system. Jakobson's arguments for discontinuity are here evaluated on the basis of data on the transition from babbling to speech in a single set of children recorded weekly in two contexts: mother-child interaction and solitary play. Using the data from the mother-child context, and comparing the sound system of babbling with that of the early words in terms of the distribution of consonants, vocalization length, and phonotactic structure, we find striking parallelism between babbling and words within each child, across time and within time period. The data constitute strong evidence for continuity.},

Our research illustrates a method to obtain measures of early speech development through automated analysis of massive quantities of day-long audio recordings collected naturalistically in children's homes. A primary goal is to provide insights into the development of infant control over infrastructural characteristics of speech through large-scale statistical analysis of strategically selected acoustic parameters. In pursuit of this goal we have discovered that the first automated approach we implemented is not only able to track children's development on acoustic parameters known to play key roles in speech, but also is able to differentiate vocalizations from typically developing children and children with autism or language delay. The method is totally automated, with no human intervention, allowing efficient sampling and analysis at unprecedented scales. The work shows the potential to fundamentally enhance research in vocal development and to add a fully objective measure to the battery used to detect speech-related disorders in early childhood. Thus, automated analysis should soon be able to contribute to screening and diagnosis procedures for early disorders, and more generally, the findings suggest fundamental methods for the study of language in natural environments.},

ASD and D/HH have increased comorbidity, but current behavioral diagnostic and screening tools have limitations. The LENA Language Autism Screen (LLAS) may offer an additional tool to disambiguate ASD from D/HH in young children. Materials and Methods: We examine empirical reports that use automatic vocal analysis methods to differentiate disordered from typically developing children. Results: Consensus across the sampled scientific literature shows support for use of automatic methods for screening and disambiguation of children with ASD and D/HH. There is some evidence of vocal differentiation between ASD, D/HH, and typically-developing children warranting use of the LLAS, but additional empirical evidence is needed to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. Conclusions: The findings reported here warrant further, more substantive, methodologically-sound research that is fully powered to show a reliable difference. Findings may be useful for both clinicians and researchers in better identification and understanding of communication disorders.},

However, the role of sampling methods in providing these measurements is rarely examined. Here we directly compare language input from hour-long video-recordings and daylong audio-recordings within the same group of 44 infants at 6 and 7 months. We compared 12 measures of language quantity and lexical diversity, talker variability, utterance-type, and object presence, finding moderate correlations across recording-types. However, video-recordings generally featured far denser noun input across these measures compared to the daylong audio-recordings, more akin to ‘peak’ audio hours (though not as high in talkers and word-types). Although audio-recordings captured 10 times more awake-time than videos, the noun input in them was only 2–4 times greater. Notably, whether we compared videos to daylong audio-recordings or peak audio times, videos featured relatively fewer declaratives and more questions; furthermore, the most common video-recorded nouns were less consistent across families than the top audio-recording nouns were. Thus, hour-long videos and daylong audio-recordings revealed fairly divergent pictures of the language infants hear and learn from in their daily lives. We suggest that short video-recordings provide a dense and somewhat different sample of infants’ language experiences, rather than a typical one, and should be used cautiously for extrapolation about common words, talkers, utterance-types, and contexts at larger timescales. If theories of language development are to be held accountable to ‘facts on the ground’ from observational data, greater care is needed to unpack the ramifications of sampling methods of early language input.},

In this study, we report on NWR results among children (N = 40, aged 3–10 years) learning Yélî Dnye, an isolate language spoken on Rossel Island in Papua New Guinea. Results make three contributions that are specific, and a fourth that is general. First, we found that non-word items containing typologically frequent sounds are repeated without changes more often than non-words containing typologically rare sounds, above and beyond any within-language frequency effects. Second, we documented rather weak effects of item length. Third, we found that NWR scores correlate strongly with age, whereas they are only weakly correlated with child sex, maternal education, and birth order. Fourth, we weave our results with those of others to serve the general goal of reflecting on how NWR scores can be compared across participants, studies, languages, and populations, and the extent to which they shed light on the factors universally structuring variation in phonological development at a global and individual level.},

	abstract = {Language input in childhood and literacy (and/or schooling) have been described as two key experiences impacting phonological processing. In this study, we assess phonological processing via a non-word repetition (NWR) group game, in adults and children living in two villages of an ethnic group where infants are rarely spoken to, and where literacy is variable. We found lower NWR scores than in previous work for both children (N = 17; aged 1-12 years) and adults (N = 13; aged 18-60 years), which is consistent with the hypothesis that there would be long-term effects on phonological processing of experiencing low levels of directed input in infancy. Additionally, we found some evidence that literacy and/or schooling increases NWR scores, although results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. These findings invite further investigations in similar communities, as current results are most compatible with phonological processing being influenced by aspects of language experience that vary greatly between and within populations.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a study of syllabic structures and their variation in a large corpus of French radio interview speech. A further aim is to show how automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can serve as a linguistic tool to consistently explore virtually unlimited speech corpora. Automatically selected subsets can be manually checked to accumulate knowledge on pronunciation variants. Our belief is that better formalised knowledge of pronunciation variant mechanisms can be obtained by analysing very large amounts of data, and will ultimately contribute to improve pronunciation modelling and ASR systems. This study is meant to be a step in this direction. The linguistic phenomena that we are particularly interested in, are sequential variants (i.e. variants with different numbers of phonemes) which may or not entail syllabic restructuring. These variants, frequent in spontaneous speech, are known to be particularly difficult for speech recognizers. To focus on sequential variants, a methodology has been set up using descriptions at the phonemic, syllabic and lexical levels. This study reports on a radio corpus composed of 30 one-hour shows of interviews. Spontaneous speech is found to have a larger proportion of closed syllables than is found in the canonical syllables derived from orthographic transcriptions. As can be expected, the optional schwa contributes to a large amount of variation in syllabic structure. Less well described phenomena are also observed, such as other vowels (/u/, /ε/, /i/ and /a/) being deleted in a non-final (unstressed) position. Unstressed CV syllables, when preceded by an open syllable, are likely to undergo syllabic restructuring: vowel deletion together with backward onset-coda transfer. Complex syllables tend to be simplified: liquid consonants have a tendancy to be deleted, more often in coda than onset position. The most deletion-prone consonant is /v/, in both onset and coda positions. Finally, a substantial percentage of word-final schwa syllables may completely disappear and short function words are deletion prone whatever the vowel identity.
Résumé
Dans ce papier, nous traitons des structures syllabiques et de leur variation dans un corpus de parole en français issu d’entrevues radio-diffusées. Un des buts est de montrer comment des systèmes de reconnaissance automatique de la parole (RAP) peuvent servir d’outils linguistiques pour explorer de façon cohérente des corpus virtuellement illimités. Des sous-ensembles automatiquement sélectionnés peuvent être vérifiés manuellement pour accroître notre connaissance des variantes de prononciation. Notre conviction est qu’une meilleure formalisation des mécanismes à l’oeuvre dans la parole contribuera en définitive à améliorer la modélisation des prononciations et les systèmes de RAP : cette étude se veut une étape dans cette direction. Les phénomènes linguistiques auxquels nous nous intéressons en particulier sont les variantes séquentielles (i.e. celles qui induisent un nombre variable de phonèmes), qui peuvent selon les cas conduire à une restructuration syllabique : ces variantes, fréquentes en parole spontanée, sont connues pour poser problème à la reconnaissance. Pour se focaliser sur elles, une méthodologie a été mise au point, utilisant des descriptions aux niveaux phonématique, syllabique et lexical. Cette étude repose sur un corpus de parole de radio constitué de trente émissions d’une heure. La parole spontanée révèle une plus grande proportion de syllabes fermées que dans les syllabes canoniques dérivées des transcriptions orthographiques : comme on peut s’y attendre, le schwa optionnel contribue pour une grande part à la variation de structure syllabique. Des phénomènes, moins bien décrits ont également été observés : d’autres voyelles telles que /u/, /ε/, /i/ et /a/ peuvent tomber en position inaccentuée (non finale). Les syllabes CV non accentuées, précédées d’une syllabe ouverte, sont enclines à la restructuration : effacement de la voyelle et transfert attaque-coda. Les syllabes complexes tendent à être simplifiées : les consonnes liquides tombent souvent, plus en position de coda qu’en position d’attaque. Le /v/ est la consonne la plus facilement élidée indépendamment de sa position dans la syllabe. Enfin un pourcentage substantiel de syllabes faibles de fin de mot, ayant un schwa comme noyau, peuvent disparaître, ainsi que les mots outils monosyllabiques indépendamment de l’identité de leur noyau vocalique.
Zusammenfassung
In diesem Beitrag beschreiben wir Silbenstrukturen und deren beobachteten Variationen in natürlich gesprochener Sprache eines französischen Rundfunkkorpus. Eine weitere Zielsetzung dieser Arbeit ist es zu zeigen wie automatische Spracherkennungssysteme als linguistische Werkzeuge zu objektiven Studien von sozusagen unbegrenzten Sprachbanken beitragen können. Die automatische Verarbeitung erlaubt eine automatische Selektion jener Teile, die geringen Einklang zwischen vorhergesehener und beobachteter Aussprache aufzeigen. Diese Auszüge sind besonders interessant für manuelle Untersuchungen. Eine vollständigere Kenntis der möglichen Varianten und Aussprachemechanismen werden zu einer genaueren Aussprachemodellierung beitragen, die dann auch in automatischen Spracherkennungssystemen von Nutzen sein werden. Die folgende Studie soll in diese Richtung gehen. Die hier beobachteten und beschriebenen Varianten bezeichnen wir als sequentielle Varianten: die Zahl von Phonemesegmenten ist variabel und kann auch eine Silbenumstrukturierung mit sich führen. Sequentielle Varianten sind besonders problematisch für Spracherkennungsysteme und treten wesentlich häufiger in spontaner als in gelesener oder vorbreiteter Sprache auf. Um diese sequentielle Varianten herauszufiltern, haben wir eine Methodologie aufgestellt, die Beschreibungen auf Phoneme- Silben- und Wortebenen benutzt. Unser Sprachkorpus enthält dreissig einstündige Radiosendungen. Die Proportion geschlossener Silben ist grösser in den beobachteten Silben als in den, von der kanonischen Ausspracheform abgeleiteten Silben. Wie vorhergesehen ist dies zu einem grossen Teil auf die Schwa-Synkope zurückzuführen. Aber weniger bekannte und beschriebene Phänomene können beobachtet werden: andere Vokale (z.B. /u/, /ε/, /i/ and /a/) können in unbetonten Silben fallen. Falls eine unbetonte KV Silbe einer offenen Silbe folgt, ist eine Silbenumstrukturierung möglich: das unbetonte Vokal fällt und K integriert die vorhergehende Silbe, die so geschlossen wird (backward onset-coda transfer). Komplexe Silben zeigen eine Tendenz zur Vereinfachung: Liquide fallen oft, und öfters in Koda- als in Kopfposition. /v/ ist der häufigst elidierte Konsonant in Kopf- und Kodaposition. Wortfinale Schwasilben sowie kurze Funktionswörter können vollkommen ausgelassen werden.},

We designed analyses of the distribution of consonantal place and manner categories in French, English, Japanese, and Swedish to determine (1) whether systematic differences can be found in the babbling and first words of infants from different language backgrounds, and, if so, (2) whether these differences are related to the phonetic structure of the language spoken in the environment. Five infants from each linguistic environment were recorded under similar conditions from babbling only to the production of 25 words in a session. Although all of the infants generally made greater use of labials, dentals, and stops than of other classes of sounds, a clear phonetic selection could already be discerned in babbling, leading to statistically significant differences among the groups. This selection can be seen to arise from phonetic patterns of the ambient language. Comparison of the babbling and infant word repertoires reveals differences reflecting the motoric consequences of sequencing constraints.},

A recent study provided a key finding to explain how contingent responses influence developmental change: infant speech-related vocalizations are contingent on responses to prior speech-related vocalizations (Warlaumont et al., 2014). However, the study did not distinguish between different speech-related vocalizations, vowel-like (V) and consonant–vowel (CV) vocalizations, which is important because CV vocalizations are a precursor to words. The present study explored parents’ responses to infants’ vocalizations and infants’ subsequent vocal production at a point when vocalizations become more like adult speech. The relative proportion of CVs following contingent responses to CV did not differ between 10- and 12-months-olds; however, there was only a significant contingent relationship between responses to CV and subsequent CV production in 12-month-olds. Results suggest a developmental transition and a social feedback loop for the production of more developmentally advanced sounds when infants are learning their first words.},

Nevertheless, building speech processing models handling such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies in which researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora which sums up to a total of 260 hours of recordings and covers 10 languages. Our model can be used as input for downstream tasks such as estimating the number of words produced by adult speakers, or the number of linguistic units produced by children. Our architecture combines SincNet filters with a stack of recurrent layers and outperforms by a large margin the state-of-the-art system, the Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) that has been used in numerous child language studies.},

	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/3bak6/},
	abstract = {Background: Turn taking appears to be an almost universal phenomenon in communicative behavior and requires tight coordination between interlocutors. However, there is no current consensus on how and when infants develop the ability to take turns in vocal interactions and which mechanisms are involved. 
Aim: The current study aims at better understanding the current state of research on the development of turn-taking behaviors in human infants. In particular, we want to map the developmental trajectory of turn-taking abilities and identify key moderators affecting them.
Method: We performed a systematic review and Bayesian multilevel meta-analysis of studies reporting response latencies in infant-adult dyadic interactions.
Results:  We found a poorly connected field (low rate of citations between papers), from which we identified 26 studies and 78 unique estimates of infant response latency. Infants display fast response latencies at an early point in development, which gradually increase up to 40 months. Infants’ responses also appear to be strongly related to the pause duration of their adult conversational partners, and are slower in groups with atypical development.
Conclusions: We identify current pitfalls and new directions of research. Specifically, we advocate for the development of shared longitudinal cross-linguistic corpora with turn-by-turn data and rich assessment of the infants' linguistic and social development. We also recommend more explicit definition and testing of computational models of the mechanisms underlying turn-taking.},

One of the biggest roadblocks standing in the way of progress lies in the datasets: The performance of a learning model is affected by the labelling quality and size of the dataset used, and infant vocalisation datasets with good quality labels tend to be small. In this paper, we assess the performance of three models for infant VoCalisation Maturity (VCM) trained with a large dataset annotated automatically using a purpose-built classifier and a small dataset annotated by highly trained human coders. The two datasets are used in three different training strategies, whose performance is compared against a baseline model. The first training strategy investigates adversarial training, while the second exploits multi-task learning as the neural network trains on both datasets simultaneously. In the final strategy, we integrate adversarial training and multi-task learning. All of the training strategies outperform the baseline, with the adversarial training strategy yielding the best results on the development set.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xmhfr},
	abstract = {Mixed effects models have become a critical tool in all areas of psychology and allied fields. This is due to their ability to account for multiple random factors, and their ability to handle proportional data in repeated measures designs. While substantial research has addressed how to structure fixed effects in such models there is less understanding of appropriate random effects structures. Recent work with linear models suggests the choice of random effects structures affects Type I error in such models (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, \&amp; Tily, 2013; Matuschek, Kliegl, Vasishth, Baayen, \&amp; Bates, 2017). This has not been examined for between subject effects, which are crucial for many areas of psychology, nor has this been examined in logistic models. Moreover, mixed models expose a number of researcher degrees of freedom: the decision to aggregate data or not, the manner in which degrees of freedom are computed, and what to do when models do not converge. However, the implications of these choices for power and Type I error are not well known. To address these issues, we conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations which examined linear and logistic models in a mixed design with crossed random effects. These suggest that a consideration of the entire space of possible models using simple information criteria such as AIC leads to optimal power while holding Type I error constant. They also suggest data aggregation and the d.f, computation have minimal effects on Type I Error and Power, and they suggest appropriate approaches for dealing with non-convergence.},

Most directed speech came in the mornings, and interactional peaks contained nearly four times the baseline rate of directed speech.

	abstract = {A comprehensive theory of child language acquisition requires an evidential base that is representative of the typological diversity present in the world?s 7000 or so languages. However, languages are dying at an alarming rate, and the next 50?years represents the last chance we have to document acquisition in many of them. Here, we take stock of the last 45?years of research published in the four main child language acquisition journals: Journal of Child Language, First Language, Language Acquisition and Language Learning and Development. We coded each article for several variables, including (1) participant group (mono vs multilingual), (2) language(s), (3) topic(s) and (4) country of author affiliation, from each journal?s inception until the end of 2020. We found that we have at least one article published on around 103 languages, representing approximately 1.5\% of the world?s languages. The distribution of articles was highly skewed towards English and other well-studied Indo-European languages, with the majority of non-Indo-European languages having just one paper. A majority of the papers focused on studies of monolingual children, although papers did not always explicitly report participant group status. The distribution of topics across language categories was more even. The number of articles published on non-Indo-European languages from countries outside of North America and Europe is increasing; however, this increase is driven by research conducted in relatively wealthy countries. Overall, the vast majority of the research was produced in the Global North. We conclude that, despite a proud history of crosslinguistic research, the goals of the discipline need to be recalibrated before we can lay claim to truly a representative account of child language acquisition.},

Twenty-four-month-old infants were presented with several novel names during a referent selection task that included both familiar and novel objects and tested for retention after a 5-min delay. The 5-min delay ensured that word learning was based on retrieval from long-term memory. Moreover, the relative familiarity of objects used during the retention test was explicitly controlled. Across experiments, infants were excellent at referent selection, but very poor at retention. Although the highly controlled retention test was clearly challenging, infants were able to demonstrate retention of the first 4 novel names presented in the session when referent selection was augmented with ostensive naming. These results suggest that fast mapping is robust for reference selection but might be more transient than previously reported for lexical retention. The relations between reference selection and retention are discussed in terms of competitive processes on 2 timescales: competition among objects on individual referent selection trials and competition among multiple novel name–object mappings made across an experimental session.},

Database searches, expert lists, and citation searches led to the discovery of 29 reports on the frequency of vocalizations directed to infants aged 24 months or younger, based on systematic observations of spontaneous activity in the infant's natural environment lasting at least 30 min in length. Together, these studies provide evidence on 1314 infants growing up in a range of communities (urban, foraging, farming). For populations located outside of North America, the frequency with which vocalization was directed to urban infants was much higher than that for rural infants (including both foraging and farming, medians = 12.6 vs. 3.6\% of observations contained infant-directed vocalization behaviors). We benchmarked this effect against socio-economic status (SES) variation in the United States, which was much smaller. Infants in high SES American homes were spoken to only slightly more frequently than those in low SES homes (medians = 16.4 vs. 15.1\% of observations contained infant-directed vocalization behaviors). Although published research represents a biased sample of the world's populations, these results invite further cross-population research to understand the causes and effects of such considerable population group differences.},

We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.},

In this paper, a predictive coding framework for a developmental agent with perception (audio), action (vocalization), and learning capabilities is proposed. The agent learns concurrently to plan optimally and the associations between sensory and motor parameters, by minimizing the sensory prediction error in an unsupervised manner. The proposed agent is solely driven by sensory prediction error and does not require reinforcement. It learns initially by self-exploration and later by imitation from the ambient environment. Our goal is to investigate the process of speech motor skill acquisition and speech production in such an agent. Standard vocal exploration experiments show that it learns to generate speech-like sounds (acoustic babbling followed by proto-syllables and vowels) as well as the timing for motor command execution. Random goal exploration leads to the self-organization of developmental stages of vocal sequences in the agent due to increase in complexity of vocalization. The self-organization is invariant to certain acoustic feature representations. Self-exploration allows the agent to learn to imitate environmental sounds quickly. It learns to vocalize differently in different environments.},

A third possible contributor to errors in the iambic form may be biological constraints, or biases, of the motor system. In the present study, 7 children with specific language impairment (SLI) and speech deficits were matched to same age peers. Multiple levels of analysis, including kinematic (modulation and stability of movement), acoustic, and transcription, were applied to children’s productions of iambic (weak-strong) and trochaic (strong-weak) prosodic forms. Findings suggest that a motor bias toward producing unmodulated rhythmic articulatory movements, similar to that observed in canonical babbling, contribute to children’s acquisition of metrical forms. Children with SLI and speech deficits show less mature segmental and speech motor systems, as well as decreased modulation of movement in later developing iambic forms. Further, components of prosodic and segmental acquisition develop independently and at different rates.},

Multiple regressions examined the relation between adult responsiveness, imitating, recasting, and expanding and infant canonical and non-canonical vocalizations with caregiver-reported infant receptive and productive vocabulary. An interaction between adult like-sound responding (i.e., the total number of imitations, recasts, and expansions) and infant canonical vocalizations indicated that infants who produced more canonical vocalizations and received more adult like-sound responses had higher productive vocabularies. When sequences were analyzed, infant canonical vocalizations that preceded and followed adult recasts and expansions were positively associated with infant productive vocabulary.

	abstract = {Few studies have focused on mechanisms of developmental change during the prelinguistic period. The lack of focus on early vocal development is surprising given that maternal responsiveness to infants during the first two years has been found to influence later language development. In addition, in a variety of species, social feedback is essential for vocal development. Previous research demonstrated that maternal feedback to prelinguistic vocalizations influenced the production of more developmentally advanced vocalizations, suggesting that effects of maternal responsiveness on vocal development may start during the prelinguistic phase; however, because mothers were instructed how and when to respond to their infants’ vocalizations, the timing and type of typical maternal feedback is unknown. In the present study, we analyzed unstructured play sessions for 10 mother-infant dyads to explore the relationship between prelinguistic vocal production and maternal responsiveness. Mothers responded contingently to prelinguistic vocalizations over 70\% of the time. Mothers responded with more vocal responses compared to interactive responses (e.g., gazes, smiling, physical contact). Investigation of specific types of vocal responses revealed that mothers responded mainly with acknowledgments to both vowel-like sounds and consonant-vowel clusters. Mothers also showed differential responding to vocalizations that varied in quality. Mothers responded with play vocalizations to vowel-like vocalizations significantly more than to consonant-vowel clusters, whereas they responded with imitations to consonant-vowel clusters more than to vowel-like sounds. Mothers, therefore, appeared to regulate their contingent feedback relative to the speech-like quality of infants’ vocalizations which may provide relevant stimulation to guide communicative development.},

While reports indicate that children in several non-Western communities may hear less adult speech which is tailored for their learning, the extent to which children’s vocalizations elicit changes in their immediate caregivers’ speech structure is presently unknown. Here we compare Tseltal Mayan and US caregivers’ verbal responses to their children’s vocalizations. Similar to findings from US dyads, we found that children in a subsistence farming community regulate the statistical structure of caregivers’ speech simply by vocalizing. Following the \_interaction burst hypothesis\_, where clusters of child-adult contingent response alternations facilitate learning from limited input, we reveal a stable source of information facilitating language learning within ongoing interaction.},

	abstract = {Infants’ prelinguistic vocalizations reliably organize vocal turn-taking with social partners, creating opportunities for learning to produce the sound patterns of the ambient language. This social feedback loop supporting early vocal learning is well-documented, but its developmental origins have yet to be addressed. When do infants learn that their non-cry vocalizations influence others? To test developmental changes in infant vocal learning, we assessed the vocalizations of 2- and 5-month-old infants in a still-face interaction with an unfamiliar adult. During the still-face, infants who have learned the social efficacy of vocalizing increase their babbling rate. In addition, to assess the expectations for social responsiveness that infants build from their everyday experience, we recorded caregiver responsiveness to their infants’ vocalizations during unstructured play. During the still-face, only 5-month-old infants showed an increase in vocalizing (a vocal extinction burst) indicating that they had learned to expect adult responses to their vocalizations. Caregiver responsiveness predicted the magnitude of the vocal extinction burst for 5-month-olds. Because 5-month-olds show a vocal extinction burst with unfamiliar adults, they must have generalized the social efficacy of their vocalizations beyond their familiar caregiver. Caregiver responsiveness to infant vocalizations during unstructured play was similar for 2- and 5-month-olds. Infants thus learn the social efficacy of their vocalizations between 2 and 5 months of age. During this time, infants build associations between their own non-cry sounds and the reactions of adults, which allows learning of the instrumental value of vocalizing.},

For example, children may coarticulate more because they are limited by immature motor control. Or they may coarticulate more if they initially represent phonological segments in larger, more holistic units such as syllables or feet. We tested the importance of several different explanations for coarticulation in child speech by evaluating how four-year-olds’ language experience, speech practice, and speech planning predicted their coarticulation between adjacent segments in real words and paired nonwords. Children with larger vocabularies coarticulated less, especially in real words, though there were no reliable coarticulatory differences between real words and nonwords after controlling for word duration. Children who vocalized more throughout a daylong audio recording also coarticulated less. Quantity of child vocalizations was more predictive of the degree of children’s coarticulation than a measure of receptive language experience, adult word count. Overall, these results suggest strong roles for children’s phonological representations and speech practice, as well as their immature fine motor control, for coarticulatory development.},

Four parameters were considered: the mean number of syllables per train, the median syllable duration with its variation coefficient, and articulatory imprecision in terms of the percentage of incomplete closures. Apart from a few subjects with minor motor deficits only, in all patients at least one of the four measures of diadochokinesis exceeded the normal range. Accordingly, discriminant analysis revealed a highly significant difference between controls and patients with respect to the considered parameters. Thus, oral diadochokinesis tasks represent a sensitive measure of orofacial motor impairment. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that Parkinson’s disease and Friedreich’s ataxia are characterized by a highly specific profile of diadochokinesis performance.},

While most of the work on automatic measurement of VOT has focused on positive VOT mostly evident in American English, in many languages the VOT can be negative. We propose an algorithm that estimates if the stop is prevoiced, and measures either positive or negative VOT, respectively. More speciﬁcally, the input to the algorithm is a speech segment of an arbitrary length containing a single stop consonant, and the output is the time of the burst onset, the duration of the burst, and the time of the prevoicing onset with a conﬁdence. Manually labeled data is used to train a recurrent neural network that can model the dynamic temporal behavior of the input signal, and outputs the events’ onset and duration. Results suggest that the proposed algorithm is superior to the current state-of-the-art both in terms of the VOT measurement and in terms of prevoicing detection.},

It is not known if features derived from speech can serve as a transdiagnostic marker of these clinical states. This study evaluates the feasibility of collecting speech samples from people with serious mental illness and explores the potential utility for tracking changes in clinical state over time. Patients (n = 47) were recruited from a community-based mental health clinic with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients used an interactive voice response system for at least 4 months to provide speech samples. Clinic providers (n = 13) reviewed responses and provided global assessment ratings. We computed features of speech and used machine learning to create models of outcome measures trained using either population data or an individual’s own data over time. The system was feasible to use, recording 1101 phone calls and 117 hours of speech. Most (92\%) of the patients agreed that it was easy to use. The individually-trained models demonstrated the highest correlation with provider ratings (rho = 0.78, p{\textless}0.001). Population-level models demonstrated statistically significant correlations with provider global assessment ratings (rho = 0.44, p{\textless}0.001), future provider ratings (rho = 0.33, p{\textless}0.05), BASIS-24 summary score, depression sub score, and self-harm sub score (rho = 0.25,0.25, and 0.28 respectively; p{\textless}0.05), and the SF-12 mental health sub score (rho = 0.25, p{\textless}0.05), but not with other BASIS-24 or SF-12 sub scores.

	abstract = {Voice onset time (VOT) is an objective temporal acoustic parameter defined as the time between the release of the oral constriction for plosive production and the onset of vocal fold vibrations. Many researchers consider VOT to be the most reliable acoustic cue for the distinction between voiced and voiceless stops. Previous studies have explored the physiological and linguistic factors underlying VOT production in normal speakers across several languages. A major clinical goal of acoustic analysis in speech disorder is to establish a correlation between the acoustic abnormalities and the phonetic perturbations. VOT could thus be used as an acoustic parameter that indicates the phonetic contrast between voiced and voiceless stops. This paper includes a critical review of the measurement of VOT, factors of VOT variability and the effect of neurogenic communication disorders on VOT. We review the VOT data from subjects who exhibit aphasia, apraxia of speech and dysarthria. These studies reveal that VOT perturbations in aphasia have been interpreted as phonemic or phonetic errors, while VOT abnormalities in apraxia of speech and dysarthria grossly reflect loss of motor control.},

	abstract = {Fast Track is a formant tracker implemented in Praat that attempts to automatically select the best analysis from a set of candidates. The best track is selected by modeling smooth formant contours across the entirety of the sound, providing the researcher with rich information about static and dynamic formant properties. Fast Track returns text files containing acoustic information (formant frequencies, formant bandwidths, fundamental frequency, etc.) sampled every 2 ms, generates images showing the winning analysis and comparing alternate analyses, and creates log files detailing analysis information for each file. Fast Track features a modular workflow that allows for analysis steps to be run (and re-run) independently as necessary, and is designed to allow for easy correction of tracking errors by allowing the user to override the automatic analysis, or manually edit tracks where necessary. In addition, Fast Track includes tools to aggregate data across tokens, and to easily create vowel plots of mean values or time-varying formant contours. The design and use of Fast Track are outlined using a re-analysis of the Hillenbrand et al. (1995) dataset, which suggests that Fast Track can be very accurate in cases where signal properties allow for reliable formant estimates.},

There is some suggestion that proficiency in phonology is correlated with motor control development. The purpose of this paper was to compare the patterns of acquisition of the control of the acoustic-phonetic cues for voicing in the speech of premature infants and controls. The measure studied was initial stop consonant voice onset time (VOT), which is known to be the most reliable acoustic cue for the distinction between voiced and voiceless stops. The total population of the study consisted of 7 infants born at less than 37 weeks gestation and a control group of 7 infants born full-term at normal weight; 7 adults, aged 24–26 years, also participated. Each child was recorded under standard recording conditions saying words contrasting labial, dental and velar voiced and voiceless initial stops. Elicited word productions were collected monthly from infants, at different age levels, ranging from 18 to 21 months. The results show that the subjects are more advanced in the acquisition of the appropriate VOT values for the voiceless than for the voiced consonants. This difficulty may be related to the increased neuromuscular control and more complex muscle activity necessary for maintaining voicing during the closure, especially for velar stops. It is important to recognize the possibility that increased variability in preterm children may be related to some neuromuscular immaturity.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia may be associated with a fundamental disturbance in the temporal coordination of information processing in the brain, leading to classic symptoms of schizophrenia such as thought disorder and disorganized and contextually inappropriate behavior. Although a variety of behavioral studies have provided strong evidence for perceptual timing deficits in schizophrenia, no study to date has directly examined overt temporal performance in schizophrenia using a task that differentially engages perceptual and motor-based timing processes. The present study aimed to isolate perceptual and motor-based temporal performance in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia using a repetitive finger-tapping task that has previously been shown to differentially engage brain regions associated with perceptual and motor-related timing behavior. Thirty-two individuals with schizophrenia and 31 non-psychiatric control participants completed the repetitive finger-tapping task, which required participants to first tap in time with computer-generated tones separated by a fixed intertone interval (tone-paced tapping), after which the tones were discontinued and participants were required to continue tapping at the established pace (self-paced tapping). Participants with schizophrenia displayed significantly faster tapping rates for both tone- and self-paced portions of the task compared to the non-psychiatric group. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia also displayed greater tapping variability during both tone- and self-paced portions of the task. The application of a mathematical timing model further indicated that group differences were primarily attributable to increased timing – as opposed to task implementation – difficulties in the schizophrenia group, which is noteworthy given the broad range of impairments typically associated with the disorder. These findings support the contention that schizophrenia is associated with a broad range of timing difficulties, including those associated with time perception as well as time production.},

Computerized analysis of patients’ speech offers a sophisticated and objective means of evaluating negative symptoms. The present study examined the feasibility and validity of using widely-available acoustic and lexical-analytic software to measure flat affect, alogia and anhedonia (via positive emotion). These measures were examined in their relationships to clinically-rated negative symptoms and social functioning. Natural speech samples were collected and analyzed for 14 patients with clinically-rated flat affect, 46 patients without flat affect and 19 healthy controls. The computer-based inflection and speech rate measures significantly discriminated patients with flat affect from controls, and the computer-based measure of alogia and negative emotion significantly discriminated the flat and nonflat patients. Both the computer and clinical measures of positive emotion/anhedonia corresponded to functioning impairments. The computerized method of assessing negative symptoms offered a number of advantages over the symptom scale-based approach.},

Results from studies using symptom rating scales suggest that these abnormalities are profound (i.e., 3–5 SDs) and occur across virtually every channel of vocal expression. Computerized acoustic analytic technologies, used to overcome practical and psychometric limitations with symptom rating scales, have found much more benign and isolated abnormalities. To better understand vocal deficits in schizophrenia and to advance acoustic analytic technologies for clinical and research applications, we examined archived speech samples from 5 separate studies, each using different speaking tasks (patient N = 309; control N = 117). We sought to: (a) use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify independent vocal expression measures from a large set of variables, (b) quantify how patients with schizophrenia are abnormal with respect to these variables, (c) evaluate the impact of demographic and contextual factors (e.g., study site, speaking task), and (d) examine the relationship between clinically—rated psychiatric symptoms and vocal variables. PCA identified 7 independent markers of vocal expression. Most of these vocal variables varied considerably as a function of context and many were associated with demographic factors. After controlling for context and demographics, there were no meaningful differences in vocal expression between patients and controls. Within patients, vocal variables were associated with a range of psychiatric symptoms—though only pause length was significantly associated with clinically rated negative symptoms. The discussion centers on explaining the apparent discordance between clinical and computerized speech measures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

For this purpose we used the Assessment Battery of Communication (ABaCo; Sacco et al., 2008). The ABaCo is a validated clinical tool for assessing pragmatic skills, which comprises five evaluation scales—linguistic, extralinguistic, paralinguistic, context, and conversational—investigating both comprehension and production of the main pragmatic phenomena involved in a communicative exchange, such as direct and indirect speech acts, irony, deceit, the violation of Grice's maxims, topic management, and turn-taking. The battery was administered to a group of seventeen patients with schizophrenia, and matched healthy controls. We expected the clinical group to perform widely worse than the control group in the different pragmatic dimensions investigated. Results showed that patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than controls on all the five scales of the battery, both in comprehension and production tasks. Moreover, the results within each scale showed a differentiated performance in the clinical group among the pragmatic phenomena, with irony assessed as the most difficult task. The implications of these results for research and treatment in schizophrenia are discussed. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will be able to: (1) summarize thepreliminary assessment of pragmatic impairments in patients with schizophrenia; (2) describea variegated communicative profile regarding different pragmatic phenomena; and (3) discuss the planning and evaluating specific rehabilitation programs.},

	abstract = {Objective
Acoustic phonetic methods are useful in examining some symptoms of schizophrenia; we used such methods to understand the underpinnings of aprosody. We hypothesized that, compared to controls and patients without clinically rated aprosody, patients with aprosody would exhibit reduced variability in: pitch (F0), jaw/mouth opening and tongue height (formant F1), tongue front/back position and/or lip rounding (formant F2), and intensity/loudness.
Methods
Audiorecorded speech was obtained from 98 patients (including 25 with clinically rated aprosody and 29 without) and 102 unaffected controls using five tasks: one describing a drawing, two based on spontaneous speech elicited through a question (Tasks 2 and 3), and two based on reading prose excerpts (Tasks 4 and 5). We compared groups on variation in pitch (F0), formant F1 and F2, and intensity/loudness.
Results
Regarding pitch variation, patients with aprosody differed significantly from controls in Task 5 in both unadjusted tests and those adjusted for sociodemographics. For the standard deviation (SD) of F1, no significant differences were found in adjusted tests. Regarding SD of F2, patients with aprosody had lower values than controls in Task 3, 4, and 5. For variation in intensity/loudness, patients with aprosody had lower values than patients without aprosody and controls across the five tasks.
Conclusions
Findings could represent a step toward developing new methods for measuring and tracking the severity of this specific negative symptom using acoustic phonetic parameters; such work is relevant to other psychiatric and neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
Aprosody, or flattened speech intonation, is a recognized negative symptom of schizophrenia, though it has rarely been studied from a linguistic/phonological perspective. To bring the latest advances in computational linguistics to the phenomenology of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, a clinical first-episode psychosis research team joined with a phonetics/computational linguistics team to conduct a preliminary, proof-of-concept study.
Methods
Video recordings from a semi-structured clinical research interview were available from 47 first-episode psychosis patients. Audio tracks of the video recordings were extracted, and after review of quality, 25 recordings were available for phonetic analysis. These files were de-noised and a trained phonologist extracted a 1-minute sample of each patient's speech. WaveSurfer 1.8.5 was used to create, from each speech sample, a file of formant values (F0, F1, F2, where F0 is the fundamental frequency and F1 and F2 are resonance bands indicating the moment-by-moment shape of the oral cavity). Variability in these phonetic indices was correlated with severity of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale negative symptom scores using Pearson correlations.
Results
A measure of variability of tongue front-to-back position—the standard deviation of F2—was statistically significantly correlated with the severity of negative symptoms (r=−0.446, p=0.03).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates a statistically significant and meaningful correlation between negative symptom severity and phonetically measured reductions in tongue movements during speech in a sample of first-episode patients just initiating treatment. Further studies of negative symptoms, applying computational linguistics methods, are warranted.},

However, the extent to which these abnormalities have predictive value for long-term psychosocial functioning is unknown. One hundred antipsychotic-naive first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients underwent extensive motor evaluation including catatonic, parkinsonism, dyskinesia, akathisia and neurological soft signs. Patients were assessed at naïve state and 6months later. Patients were followed-up in their naturalistic treatment and settings and their psychosocial functioning was assessed at 6-month, 1year, 5year and 10years from the FEP by collecting all available information. A set of linear mixed models were built to account for the repeated longitudinal assessment of psychosocial functioning during the follow-up regarding to the five domains of MAs (catatonic, parkinsonism, akathisia, dyskinesia and neurologic soft-signs) at index episode at antipsychotic naïve state and after 6months of FEP. Basic epidemiological variables, schizophrenia diagnosis and average of chlorpromazine equivalent doses of antipsychotic drugs were included as covariates. Catatonic signs and dyskinesia at drug-naïve state were significantly associated with poor long-term psychosocial functioning. Moreover, higher scores on parkinsonism, akathisia, neurological soft signs and catatonic signs at 6-month of FEP but not dyskinesia showed significant associations with poor long-term psychosocial functioning. Our results added empirical evidence to motor abnormalities as core manifestations of psychotic illness before and after antipsychotic treatment with high predictive value for poor long-term psychosocial functioning in FEP patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Finger-tapping has been widely studied using behavioral and neuroimaging paradigms. Evidence supports the use of finger-tapping as an endophenotype in schizophrenia, but its relationship with motor procedural learning remains unexplored. To our knowledge, this study presents the first use of index finger-tapping to study procedural learning in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SCZ/SZA) as compared to healthy controls.
Methods
A computerized index finger-tapping test was administered to 1169 SCZ/SZA patients (62\% male, 88\% right-handed), and 689 healthy controls (40\% male, 93\% right-handed). Number of taps per trial and learning slopes across trials for the dominant and non-dominant hands were examined for motor speed and procedural learning, respectively.
Results
Both healthy controls and SCZ/SZA patients demonstrated procedural learning for their dominant hand but not for their non-dominant hand. In addition, patients showed a greater capacity for procedural learning even though they demonstrated more variability in procedural learning compared to healthy controls. Left-handers of both groups performed better than right-handers and had less variability in mean number of taps between non-dominant and dominant hands. Males also had less variability in mean tap count between dominant and non-dominant hands than females. As expected, patients had a lower mean number of taps than healthy controls, males outperformed females and dominant-hand trials had more mean taps than non-dominant hand trials in both groups.
Conclusions
The index finger-tapping test can measure both motor speed and procedural learning, and motor procedural learning may be intact in SCZ/SZA patients.},

Despite the practical utility of sensorimotor abnormalities for early identification, prediction, and individualized medicine applications, there is currently no dedicated self-report instrument designed to capture these important behaviors. The current study assessed and validated a questionnaire designed for use in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR). The current study included both exploratory (n = 3009) and validation (n = 439) analytic datasets—that included individuals identified as meeting criteria for a CHR syndrome (n = 84)—who completed the novel Sensorimotor Abnormalities and Psychosis-Risk (SMAP-R) Scale, clinical interviews and a finger-tapping task. The structure of the scale and reliability of items were consistent across 2 analytic datasets. The resulting scales were assessed for discriminant validity across CHR, community sample non-psychiatric volunteer, and clinical groups. The scale showed a consistent structure across 2 analytic datasets subscale structure. The resultant subscale structure was consistent with conceptual models of sensorimotor pathology in psychosis (coordination and dyskinesia) in both the exploratory and the validation analytic dataset. Further, these subscales showed discriminant, predictive, and convergent validity. The sensorimotor abnormality scales discriminated CHR from community sample non-psychiatric controls and clinical samples. Finally, these subscales predicted to risk calculator scores and showed convergent validity with sensorimotor performance on a finger-tapping task. The SMAP-R scale demonstrated good internal, discriminant, predictive, and convergent validity, and subscales mapped on to conceptually relevant sensorimotor circuits. Features of the scale may facilitate widespread incorporation of sensorimotor screening into psychosis-risk research and practice.},

However, to date, our perspective of brain-behavior relationships has been informed solely by cross-sectional correlational studies linking behavior in the lab to brain structure or respective resting-state network connectivity. Here, we assess movement dysfunction from 2 perspectives: study 1 investigates the longitudinal progression of handwriting variability and positive symptoms in a sample of 91 CHR and healthy controls during a 12-month follow-up and study 2 involves a multiband functional magnetic resonance imaging task exploring the relationship between power grip force stability and motor network brain activation in a subset of participants. In study 1, we found that greater handwriting variability was a stable feature of CHR participants who experienced worse symptom progression. Study 2 results showed that CHR individuals had greater variability in their grip force and greater variability was related to decreased activation in the associative cortico-striatal network compared to controls. Motor variability may be a stable marker of vulnerability for psychosis risk and possible indicator of a vulnerable cortico-striatal brain network functioning in CHR participants, although the effects of antipsychotic medication should be considered.},

This count-by-time procedure has required two separate operations—one to measure time and the other to count syllables within time. A time-by-count strategy is proposed to enable an examiner to collect diadochokinetic measurements in sequential rather than overlapping tasks. Oscillographic and stop watch measurements, using the proposed new procedure, were generated and expressed as norms from syllable repetitions of 384 school-age children. The two measurements produced equivalent data. It was therefore concluded that the time-by-count procedure can produce accurate estimates of diadochokinetic syllable production. Additional conclusions regarding age, sex, and stimulus order are presented.},

	abstract = {There is increased need for efficient computerized methods to collect reliable data on a range of cognitive domains that can be linked to specific brain systems. Such need arises in functional neuroimaging studies, where individual differences in cognitive performance are variables of interest or serve as confounds. In genetic studies of complex behavior, which require particularly large samples, such trait measures can serve as endophenotypes. Traditional neuropsychological tests, based on clinical pathological correlations, are protracted, require extensive training in administration and scoring, and leave lengthy paper trails (double-entry for analysis). We present a computerized battery that takes an average of 1h and provides measures of accuracy and speed on 9 neurocognitive domains. They are cognitive neuroscience-based in that they have been linked experimentally to specific brain systems with functional neuroimaging studies. We describe the process of translating tasks used in functional neuroimaging to tests for assessing individual differences. Data are presented on each test with samples ranging from 139 (81 female) to 536 (311 female) of carefully screened healthy individuals ranging in age from 18 to 84. Item consistency was established with acceptable to high Cronbach alpha coefficients. Inter-item correlations were moderate to high within domain and low to nil across domains, indicating construct validity. Initial criterion validity was demonstrated by sensitivity to sex differences and the effects of age, education and parental education. These results encourage the use of this battery in studies needing an efficient assessment of major neurocognitive domains such as multi-site genetic studies and clinical trials.},

Methods from computational linguistics have increasingly sought to quantify thought disorder to detect group differences between clinical populations and healthy controls. While previous work has been quite successful at these classification tasks, the lack of interpretability of the computational metrics has made it unclear whether they are in fact measuring thought disorder. In this paper, we dive into these measures to try to better understand what they reflect. While we find group differences between at-risk and healthy control populations, we also find that the measures mostly do not correlate with existing measures of thought disorder symptoms (what they are intended to measure), but rather correlate with surface properties of the speech (e.g., sentence length) and sociodemographic properties of the speaker (e.g., race). These results highlight the importance of considering interpretability and front and center as the field continues to grow. Ethical use of computational measures like those studied here – especially in the high-stakes context of clinical care – requires us to devote substantial attention to potential biases in our measures.},

Speech motor control refers to the systems and strategies that regulate the production of speech, including the planning and preparation of movements (sometimes called motor programming) and the execution of movement plans to result in muscle contractions and structural displacements. Traditionally, speech motor control is distinguished from phonologic operations, but in some recent phonologic theories, there is a deliberate blurring of the boundaries between phonologic representation and motor functions. Moreover, there is continuing discussion in the literature as to whether a given motor speech disorder (especially apraxia of speech and stuttering) should be understood at the phonologic level, the motoric level, or both of these. The motor speech disorders considered here include: the dysarthrias, apraxia of speech, developmental apraxia of speech, developmental stuttering, acquired (neurogenic and psychogenic) stuttering, and cluttering.},

This paper reviews studies showing that specific acoustic analyses have demonstrated or potential value toward the overall goal of constructing acoustic profiles of dysarthria and apraxia of speech. Several different acoustic measures are relevant to the study of the motor speech disorders, and these are increasingly supported by normative data and by guidelines for clinical application.

Results revealed that the short lag category did not change as a function of speaking rate in any of the three languages examined, although VOT values for long lag (Thai and English) and pre-voiced (Thai and French) stop consonants were affected by changes in speaking rate. However, the shift of the long lag and pre-voiced categories toward the short lag VOT values in the fast rate condition resulted in little overlap between voicing categories. Implications of these results for the nature of phonetic categories are discussed.},

Stops were measured from three children recorded regularly between 1 and 2 years of age and from additional children ranging in age from 6 months to 4½ years. Frequency distributions of apical stops along the VOT continuum are compared longitudinally across subjects and with distributions of adult productions of word-initial /d/ and /t/. Drawing on a physiological discussion of the control of timing between stop release and onset of vocal fold oscillation, a pattern of apical stop development is proposed. The earliest examples of stops, around 6 months of age, have uniform distributions along the VOT continuum. Later the distributions of apical stops collapse into an interval corresponding to that of American English /d/. With further development some apical stops are added in the range of adult /t/. The distributions for both /d/ and /t/ words are similar between the ages of 2 and 4½ years, but they do not yet correspond to those of adults.},

A truly voiced stop (i.e., one realized with voicing onset before the burst), is a difficult sound because the buildup of supralaryngeal air pressure during stop closure conflicts with aerodynamic requirements of the glottal gesture. Prior studies show that young language learners of French, Thai or Spanish are hindered by this fact, not mastering the voiced stops of these languages until age 4 or 5 [1, 4, 8]. In order to assess the effects of such physical constraints on language acquisition, we examine the acoustics of Greek voiced stops and investigate how Greek learners deal with the articulatory difficulty of producing voiced stops. Word-initial Greek voiced stop productions were recorded in two sets of experiments and were analyzed in terms of amplitude change during the closure and around the burst. We discuss how the languagespecific phonetic properties of Greek voiced stops affect the acquisition of them in Greek-speaking children. Our results suggest that the very detailed phonetic descriptions of phonetic categories must be counted to provide properly nuanced prediction about developmental universals.},

Performing the first continuous kinematic-acoustic analysis in individuals with schizophrenia, we examined gesture-speech synchrony in solo spontaneous speech and in sensorimotor synchronization task. The experimental group consisted of twenty-eight participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and the control group consisted of twenty-four healthy participants age-gender-education matched. The results showed that spontaneous gesture-speech synchrony was preserved while intentional finger tapping-speech synchrony was impaired. In sensorimotor synchronization task, the schizophrenia group displayed greater asynchronies between finger tapping and syllable uttering and lower stability of coordination patterns. These findings suggest a specific deficit in time delay of information circulation and processing, especially in explicit functions. Thus, investigating intrapersonal coordination in schizophrenia may constitute a promising window into brain/behavior dynamic relationship.},

Impaired recognition of emotions from a tone of voice (receptive prosody) has been described as characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the ability to express non-verbal information in speech (expressive prosody) has been understudied. This paper describes a useful technique for quantifying the degree of expressive prosody deficits in schizophrenia, using a semi-automatic method, and evaluates this method’s ability to discriminate between patient and control groups. Forty-five medicated patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were matched with thirty-five healthy comparison subjects. Production of expressive prosodic speech was analyzed using variation in fundamental frequency (F0) measures on an emotionally neutral reading task. Results revealed that patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly more pauses (p {\textless} .001), were slower (p {\textless} .001), and showed less pitch variability in speech (p {\textless} .05) and fewer variations in syllable timing (p {\textless} .001) than control subjects. These features have been associated with «flat» speech prosody. Signal processing algorithms applied to speech were shown to be capable of discriminating between patients and controls with an accuracy of 93.8\%. These speech parameters may have a diagnostic and prognosis value and therefore could be used as a dependent measure in clinical trials.},

We evaluate MFA’s performance on aligning word and phone boundaries in English conversational and laboratory speech, relative to human-annotated boundaries, focusing on the effects of aligner architecture and training on the data to be aligned. MFA performs well relative to two existing open-source aligners with simpler architecture (Prosodylab-Aligner and FAVE), and both its improved architecture and training on data to be aligned generally result in more accurate boundaries.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) was designed to measure performance accuracy and speed on specific neurobehavioral domains using tests that were previously validated with functional neuroimaging. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the neuropsychological theory used to construct the CNB by confirming the factor structure of the tests composing it. Method: In a large community sample (N = 9,138; age range 8–21), we performed a correlated-traits confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) on the 12 CNB measures of Efficiency (which combine Accuracy and Speed). We then performed EFAs of the Accuracy and Speed measures separately. Finally, we performed a confirmatory bifactor analysis of the Efficiency scores. All analyses were performed with Mplus using maximum likelihood estimation. Results: Results strongly support the a priori theory used to construct the CNB, showing that tests designed to measure executive, episodic memory, complex cognition, and social cognition aggregate their loadings within these domains. When Accuracy and Speed were analyzed separately, Accuracy produced 3 reliable factors: executive and complex cognition, episodic memory, and social cognition, while speed produced 2 factors: tests that require fast responses and those where each item requires deliberation. The statistical “Fit” of almost all models described above was acceptable (usually excellent). Conclusions: Based on the analysis from these large-scale data, the CNB offers an effective means for measuring the integrity of intended neurocognitive domains in about 1 hour of testing and is thus suitable for large-scale clinical and genomic studies.

This study evaluates the pattern of neuropsychological deficits and their association with clinical symptomatology and social functioning in individuals identified as ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis.
Methods
A sample of 45 UHR individuals was identified using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) from consecutive referrals to the Staglin Music Festival Center for the Assessment and Prevention of Prodromal States (CAPPS) at UCLA. Participants were administered a neurocognitive test battery, as well as measures of global (Strauss–Carpenter Outcome Scale) and social functioning (UCLA Social Attainment Survey).
Results
Participants showed significant deficits in speed of processing, verbal learning and memory, and motor speed. Poorer verbal learning and memory performance was significantly associated with poorer social functioning, and there was a trend for poorer performance on reasoning and problem solving to be associated with poorer global functioning. Verbal memory independently predicted social functioning over and above severity of negative symptoms. Cognitive deficits were not associated with severity of clinical symptomatology.
Conclusions
Despite the absence of fully psychotic symptoms, UHR individuals experience significant cognitive deficits, particularly on tasks requiring speeded information-processing and efficient recall from memory, and these deficits appear to be associated with functional disability in a manner parallel to that observed in patients with established psychotic illness.},

Among this list, psychomotor slowing in particular is one of the most consistently observed and robust findings in the field. Critically, psychomotor slowing may serve as a uniquely promising endophenotype and/or biomarker for schizophrenia considering it is frequently observed in those with genetic vulnerability for the illness, predicts transition in subjects at high-risk for the disorder, and is associated with symptoms and recovery in patients. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of the history of psychomotor slowing in psychosis, discuss its possible neural underpinnings, and review the current literature supporting slowing as a putative endophenotype and/or biomarker for the illness. This review summarizes substantial evidence from a diverse array of methodologies and research designs that supports the notion that psychomotor slowing not only reflects genetic vulnerability, but is also sensitive to disease processes and the pathophysiology of the illness. Furthermore, there are unique deficits across the cognitive (prefix “psycho”) and motor execution (root word “motor”) aspects of slowing, with cognitive processes such as planning and response selection being particularly affected. These findings suggest that psychomotor slowing may serve as a promising endophenotype and biomarker for schizophrenia that may prove useful for identifying individuals at greatest risk and tracking the course of the illness and recovery.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Language disorders – disorganized and incoherent speech in particular - are distinctive features of schizophrenia. Natural language processing (NLP) offers automated measures of incoherent speech as promising markers for schizophrenia. However, the scientific and clinical impact of NLP markers depends on their generalizability across contexts, samples, and languages, which we systematically assessed in the present study relying on a large, novel, cross-linguistic corpus.
Methods
We collected a Danish (DK), German (GE), and Chinese (CH) cross-linguistic dataset involving transcripts from 187 participants with schizophrenia (111DK, 25GE, 51CH) and 200 matched controls (129DK, 29GE, 42CH) performing the Animated Triangles Task. Fourteen previously published NLP coherence measures were calculated, and between-groups differences and association with symptoms were tested for cross-linguistic generalizability.
Results
One coherence measure, i.e. second-order coherence, robustly generalized across samples and languages. We found several language-specific effects, some of which partially replicated previous findings (lower coherence in German and Chinese patients), while others did not (higher coherence in Danish patients). We found several associations between symptoms and measures of coherence, but the effects were generally inconsistent across languages and rating scales.
Conclusions
Using a cumulative approach, we have shown that NLP findings of reduced semantic coherence in schizophrenia have limited generalizability across different languages, samples, and measures. We argue that several factors such as sociodemographic and clinical heterogeneity, cross-linguistic variation, and the different NLP measures reflecting different clinical aspects may be responsible for this variability. Future studies should take this variability into account in order to develop effective clinical applications targeting different patient populations.},

	abstract = {Voice atypicalities have been a characteristic feature of schizophrenia since its first definitions. They are often associated with core negative symptoms such as flat affect and alogia, and with the social impairments seen in the disorder. This suggests that voice atypicalities may represent a marker of clinical features and social functioning in schizophrenia. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence for distinctive acoustic patterns in schizophrenia, as well as their relation to clinical features. We identified 46 articles, including 55 studies with a total of 1254 patients with schizophrenia and 699 healthy controls. Summary effect sizes (Hedges'g and Pearson's r) estimates were calculated using multilevel Bayesian modeling. We identified weak atypicalities in pitch variability (g = −0.55) related to flat affect, and stronger atypicalities in proportion of spoken time, speech rate, and pauses (g's between −0.75 and −1.89) related to alogia and flat affect. However, the effects were mostly modest (with the important exception of pause duration) compared to perceptual and clinical judgments, and characterized by large heterogeneity between studies. Moderator analyses revealed that tasks with a more demanding cognitive and social component showed larger effects both in contrasting patients and controls and in assessing symptomatology. In conclusion, studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but, yet unsystematic avenue for establishing markers of schizophrenia. We outline recommendations towards more cumulative, open, and theory-driven research.},

	abstract = {Videoconferencing has become an increasingly viable tool in psychiatry, with a growing body of literature on its use with a range of patient populations. A number of factors make it particularly well suited for patients with psychosis. For example, patients living in remote or underserved areas can be seen by a specialist without need for travel. However, the hallmark symptoms of psychotic disorders might lead one to question the feasibility of videoconferencing with these patients. For example, does videoconferencing exacerbate delusions, such as paranoia or delusions of reference? Are acutely psychotic patients willing to be interviewed remotely by videoconferencing? To address these and other issues, we conducted an extensive review of Medline, PsychINFO, and the Telemedicine Information Exchange databases for literature on videoconferencing and psychosis. Findings generally indicated that assessment and treatment via videoconferencing is equivalent to in person and is tolerated and well accepted. There is little evidence that patients with psychosis have difficulty with videoconferencing or experience any exacerbation of symptoms; in fact, there is some evidence to suggest that the distance afforded can be a positive factor. The results of two large clinical trials support the reliability and effectiveness of centralized remote assessment of patients with schizophrenia.},

When the voicing onset precedes burst onset the VOT is negative; if voicing onset follows the burst, it is positive. In this work, we present a deep-learning model for accurate and reliable measurement of VOT in naturalistic speech. The proposed system addresses two critical issues: it can measure positive and negative VOT equally well, and it is trained to be robust to variation across annotations. Our approach is based on the structured prediction framework, where the feature functions are defined to be RNNs. These learn to capture segmental variation in the signal. Results suggest that our method substantially improves over the current state-of-the-art. In contrast to previous work, our Deep and Robust VOT annotator, Dr.VOT, can successfully estimate negative VOTs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on positive VOTs. This high level of performance generalizes to new corpora without further retraining.

Critically, these features are of prognostic value in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and for those in early stages of psychotic disorders. Motor abnormalities such as tremor, rigidity, and neurological soft signs often go unrecognized. Currently, advances in this area are limited by a paucity of theoretical conceptions categorizing or linking these behaviours to underlying neurobiology affected in psychosis. However, emerging technological advances have significantly improved the ability to detect and assess motor abnormalities with objective instruments in a timely and reliable manner. Further, converging evidence has laid the groundwork for theoretically and empirically derived categorization and conceptualization. This review summarizes these advances, stressing the importance of motor abnormalities for understanding vulnerability across different stages of psychosis and introducing these innovative instrumental approaches. Patients, researchers and clinicians will benefit from these new developments, as better assessment aids the development of targeted interventions to ultimately improve the care for individuals experiencing psychosis.},

	abstract = {Classical schizophrenia literature reports motor symptoms as characteristic of the disorder. After the introduction of neuroleptic drugs, the existence of genuine motor disorders was challenged. Renewed interest arose as symptoms were found in never-medicated patients. Reports focused on abnormal involuntary movements, parkinsonism, neurological soft signs, catatonia, negative symptoms, or psychomotor slowing. Since these syndromes refer to different concepts, however, the definitions are not congruent and the symptoms overlap. The prevalence rates of motor symptoms in schizophrenia are surprisingly high, and recent studies indicate a possible pathobiology. In particular, the development and maturation of the human motor system appears to be closely linked to the emergence of motor symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Post-mortem and neuroimaging results demonstrated aberrant structure and function of premotor and motor cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the connecting white matter tracts. Animal models have focused on aberrant neurotransmission and genetic contributions. Findings of localized abnormal oligodendrocyte function and myelination point to the special role of the white matter in schizophrenia, and recent studies specifically found an association between motor abnormalities and white matter structure in schizophrenia. This review of the literature supports the idea that motor symptoms are closely related to the neurodevelopmental disturbances of schizophrenia and a distinct syndromal dimension with its own pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {The speech signal is rife with variations in phonetic ambiguity. For instance, when talkers speak in a conversational register, they demonstrate less articulatory precision, leading to greater potential for confusability at the phonetic level compared to a clear speech register. Current psycholinguistic models assume that ambiguous speech sounds activate more than one phonological category, and that competition at prelexical levels cascades to lexical levels of processing. Imaging studies have shown that the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) is modulated by phonetic competition between simultaneously activated categories, with increases in activation for more ambiguous tokens. Yet these studies have often used artificially manipulated speech and/or metalinguistic tasks, which arguably may recruit neural regions that are not critical for natural speech recognition. Indeed, a prominent model of speech processing, the Dual Stream Model, posits that the LIFG is not involved in prelexical processing in receptive language processing. In the current study, we exploited natural variation in phonetic competition in the speech signal in order to investigate the neural systems sensitive to phonetic competition as listeners engaged in a receptive language task. Participants heard nonsense sentences spoken in either a clear or conversational register as neural activity was monitored using fMRI. Conversational sentences contained greater phonetic competition, as estimated by measures of vowel confusability, and these sentences also elicited greater activation in a region in the LIFG. Sentence-level phonetic competition metrics uniquely correlated with LIFG activity as well. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the LIFG responds to competition at multiple levels of language processing, and that recruitment of this region does not require an explicit phonological judgment.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThis study aim to derive and validate a simple and well-performing risk calculator (RC) for predicting psychosis in individual patients at clinical high risk (CHR).MethodsFrom the ongoing ShangHai-At-Risk-for-Psychosis (SHARP) program, 417 CHR cases were identified based on the Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms (SIPS), of whom 349 had at least 1-year follow-up assessment. Of these 349 cases, 83 converted to psychosis. Logistic regression was used to build a multivariate model to predict conversion. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to test the effectiveness of the SIPS-RC. Second, an independent sample of 100 CHR subjects was recruited based on an identical baseline and follow-up procedures to validate the performance of the SIPS-RC.ResultsFour predictors (each based on a subset of SIPS-based items) were used to construct the SIPS-RC: (1) functional decline; (2) positive symptoms (unusual thoughts, suspiciousness); (3) negative symptoms (social anhedonia, expression of emotion, ideational richness); and (4) general symptoms (dysphoric mood). The SIPS-RC showed moderate discrimination of subsequent transition to psychosis with an AUC of 0.744 (p {\textless} 0.001). A risk estimate of 25\% or higher had around 75\% accuracy for predicting psychosis. The personalized risk generated by the SIPS-RC provided a solid estimate of conversion outcomes in the independent validation sample, with an AUC of 0.804 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.662–0.951].ConclusionThe SIPS-RC, which is simple and easy to use, can perform in the same manner as the NAPLS-2 RC in the Chinese clinical population. Such a tool may be used by clinicians to counsel appropriately their patients about clinical monitor v. potential treatment options.},

Between-task comparisons were made for subsamples of a population of 140 patients with different motor speech syndromes, including apraxia of speech and cerebellar dysarthria. In a further analysis subgroups were matched for speaking rate. Overall, dysdiadochokinesis was correlated with the degree of speech impairment, but there was a strong interaction between task type and motor speech syndrome. In particular, cerebellar pathology affected DDK to a relatively greater extent than sentence production, while apraxic pathology spared the ability of repeating syllables at maximum speed.},

However, the neurocognitive correlates of parkinsonism in this population remained to be clarified. A sample comprising 100 consecutive drug-naive patients with first-episode psychosis were enrolled on the study and followed up for 6 months. Seventy-seven completed assessments at 3 time points (baseline, 1 mo, and 6 mo), involving clinical and cognitive examinations and a specific assessment of motor abnormalities. The Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) was used for the assessment of extrapyramidal signs, and each motor domain was evaluated with a standard assessment scale. Linear mixed models were built to explore the longitudinal relationships between parkinsonism scores and cognitive impairment. Parkinsonism scores showed significant strong longitudinal associations with deficits in memory, executive functioning, and attention. Spontaneous parkinsonism (total SAS score and hypokinesia and rigidity subscores at baseline) showed high 6-month predictive values for cognitive impairment. In addition, they also had high predictive values for neurologic soft-sign abnormalities but not for dyskinesia, akathisia, and pure catatonic abnormalities. No predictive value was found for glabella-salivation or tremor subscores on the SAS scale. These results emphasize the relevance of the assessment of parkinsonism signs prior to starting to administer antipsychotic drugs, as core manifestations of psychotic illness with a high predictive value for cognitive impairment.},

To date, there have been no published longitudinal studies examining the progression of movement abnormalities and their relation with symptom progression in at-risk youth.To examine the progression of movement abnormalities in relation to positive and negative symptoms in adolescents at high risk of developing psychotic disorders.Naturalistic, prospective, longitudinal design.Participants recruited through announcements directed at parents of adolescents showing schizotypal symptoms.One hundred twenty-one adolescents (mean baseline age, 14.26 years), 32 with schizotypal personality disorder, 49 nonclinical controls, and 40 with other personality disorders.Participating adolescents were evaluated for personality disorders (Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders), prodromal symptoms (Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms), and movement abnormalities (Dyskinesia Identification System Condensed User Scale) at 3 annual assessments.The schizotypal group exhibited significantly elevated movement abnormalities in comparison with controls across all 3 time points. Further, the schizotypal personality disorder group alone showed significant increases in movement abnormalities over time. Movement abnormalities were correlated with prodromal symptoms at each time period, and for several body regions, the magnitude of this relationship significantly increased over time.The results are consistent with the hypothesis of shared neural circuitry for movement abnormalities and psychotic symptoms and suggest the potential value of including an assessment of motor signs in screening for psychosis risk.Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2008;65(2):165-171--{\textgreater}},

The drawbacks of these methods are long training times for raters, experimenter bias, large site differences in instrumental apparatus, and suboptimal reliability. Taking these drawbacks into account has guided the development of better standardized and more efficient procedures to examine movement abnormalities through handwriting analysis software and tablet. Individuals at risk for psychosis showed significantly more dysfluent pen movements (a proximal measure for dyskinesia) in a handwriting task.

	abstract = {Voice onset time (VOT) is an objective temporal acoustic parameter defined as the time between the release of the oral constriction for plosive production and the onset of vocal fold vibrations. Many researchers consider VOT to be the most reliable acoustic cue for the distinction between voiced and voiceless stops. Previous studies have explored the physiological and linguistic factors underlying VOT production in normal speakers across several languages. A major clinical goal of acoustic analysis in speech disorder is to establish a correlation between the acoustic abnormalities and the phonetic perturbations. VOT could thus be used as an acoustic parameter that indicates the phonetic contrast between voiced and voiceless stops. This paper includes a critical review of the measurement of VOT, factors of VOT variability and the effect of neurogenic communication disorders on VOT. We review the VOT data from subjects who exhibit aphasia, apraxia of speech and dysarthria. These studies reveal that VOT perturbations in aphasia have been interpreted as phonemic or phonetic errors, while VOT abnormalities in apraxia of speech and dysarthria grossly reflect loss of motor control.},

	abstract = {While voice onset time (VOT) is known to be sensitive to a range of phonetic and linguistic factors, much less is known about VOT in spontaneous speech, since most studies consider stops in single words, in sentences, and/or in read speech. Scottish English is typically said to show less aspirated voiceless stops than other varieties of English, but there is also variation, ranging from unaspirated stops in vernacular speakers to more aspirated stops in Scottish Standard English; change in the vernacular has also been suggested. This paper presents results from a study which used a fast, semi-automated procedure for analyzing positive VOT, and applied it to stressed syllable-initial stops from a real- and apparent-time corpus of naturally-occurring spontaneous Glaswegian vernacular speech. We confirm significant effects on VOT for place of articulation and local speaking rate, and trends for vowel height and lexical frequency. With respect to time, our results are not consistent with previous work reporting generally shorter VOT in elderly speakers, since our results from models which control for local speech rate show lengthening over real-time in the elderly speakers in our sample. Overall, our findings suggest that VOT in both voiceless and voiced stops is lengthening over the course of the twentieth century in this variety of Scottish English. They also support observations from other studies, both from Scotland and beyond, indicating that gradient shifts along the VOT continuum reflect subtle sociolinguistic control.},

However, the long-term course of neurocognition and a possible neurotoxic effect of time spent in active psychosis, is a topic of controversy. Furthermore, it is of importance to find out what predicts the long-term course of neurocognition. Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), accumulated time in psychosis the first year after start of treatment, relapse rates and symptoms are potential predictors of the long-term course. In this study, 261 first-episode psychosis patients were assessed neuropsychologically on one or more occasions. Patients were tested after remission of psychotic symptoms and reassessed 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after inclusion. The neurocognitive battery consisted of California Verbal Learning Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Task, Trail Making A and B, and Finger Tapping. We calculated a composite score by adding the z-scores of 4 tests that were only moderately inter-correlated, not including Finger Tapping. Data were analyzed by a linear mixed model. The composite score was stable over 10 years. No significant relationship between psychosis before (DUP) or after start of treatment and the composite score was found, providing no support for the neurotoxicity hypothesis, and indicating that psychosis before start of treatment has no significant impact on the course and outcome in psychosis. We found no association between symptoms and the neurocognitive trajectory. Stable remission during the first year predicted neurocognitive functioning, suggesting that the early clinical course is a good predictor for the long-term course.},

In this pre-registered study, we directly examine the link between lexical access and phonetic processes in Spanish–English bilinguals using picture naming. Using automated acoustic analysis, we simultaneously gather measures of reaction time (indexing lexical access) and acoustic properties of the initial consonant and vowel (indexing phonetic processes) for the same speakers on the same trials. Across measures, we find consistent, robust effects of mixing and language dominance. In contrast, while switching effects are robust in reaction time measures, they are not detected in phonetic measures.

	abstract = {Background
Growing evidence suggests that movement abnormalities occur prior to the onset of psychosis. Innovations in technology and software provide the opportunity for a fine-tuned and sensitive measurement of observable behavior that may be particularly useful to detecting the subtle movement aberrations present during the prodromal period.
Methods
In the present study, 54 youth at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for psychosis and 62 healthy controls participated in structured clinical interviews to assess for an UHR syndrome. The initial 15min of the baseline clinical interview was assessed using Motion Energy Analysis (MEA) providing frame-by-frame measures of total movement, amplitude, speed, and variability of both head and body movement separately.
Results
Result showed region-specific group differences such that there were no differences in head movement but significant differences in body movement. Specifically, the UHR group showed greater total body movement and speed of body movements, and lower variation in body movement compared to healthy controls. However, there were no significant associations with positive, negative or disorganized symptom domains.
Conclusion
This study represents an innovative perspective on gross motor function in the UHR group. Importantly, the automated approach used in this study provides a sensitive and objective measure of body movement abnormalities, potentially guiding novel assessment and prevention of symptom development in those at risk for psychosis.},

	abstract = {Despite known deficits in postural control in patients with schizophrenia, this domain has not been investigated in youth at ultra high-risk (UHR) for psychosis. This is particularly relevant as postural control implicates dysfunction in the cerebellum-a region implicated in cognitive dysmetria conceptions of schizophrenia but poorly understood in the prodrome. Here, we extended our understanding of movement abnormalities in UHR individuals to include postural control, and have linked these deficits to both symptom severity and cerebello-cortical network connectivity. UHR and healthy control participants completed an instrumentally based balance task to quantify postural control along with a resting state brain imaging scan to investigate cerebellar networks. We also quantified positive and negative symptom severity with structured clinical interviews. The UHR group showed overall increased postural sway and decreased cerebello-cortical resting state connectivity, relative to controls. The decreased cerebello-cortical connectivity was seen across multiple networks. Postural sway was also correlated with cerebellar connectivity in this population and uniquely positively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms. Finally, symptom severity was also associated with cerebellar connectivity. Together, our results point to a potential deficit in sensory integration as an underlying contributor to the increased postural sway, and provide evidence of cerebellar abnormalities in UHR individuals. These results extend our understanding of the motor abnormalities of UHR individuals beyond striatum-based dyskinesias to include postural control and sensory integration deficits, and implicate the cerebellum as a distinct neural substrate preceding the onset of psychosis. Taken together, our results extend the cognitive dysmetria framework to UHR populations. Hum Brain Mapp 35:4064–4078, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Critically, these features are of prognostic value in individuals at-risk for psychosis, and for those in early stages of psychotic disorders. Motor abnormalities such as tremor, rigidity, and neurological soft signs often go unrecognized. Currently, advances in this area are limited by a paucity of theoretical conceptions categorizing or linking these behaviours to underlying neurobiology affected in psychosis. However, emerging technological advances have significantly improved the ability to detect and assess motor abnormalities with objective instruments in a timely and reliable manner. Further, converging evidence has laid the groundwork for theoretically and empirically derived categorization and conceptualization. This review summarizes these advances, stressing the importance of motor abnormalities for understanding vulnerability across different stages of psychosis and introducing these innovative instrumental approaches. Patients, researchers and clinicians will benefit from these new developments, as better assessment aids the development of targeted interventions to ultimately improve the care for individuals experiencing psychosis.},

	abstract = {The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia—version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.},

METHOD: The offspring were tested with neurobehavioral measures at 7–12 years of age and assessed in mid-adulthood for axis I diagnoses. The relationships of childhood deficits in attention, verbal memory, and gross motor skills to adulthood schizophrenia-related psychoses were examined in separate path analyses by using logistic regression equations. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for each of the childhood dysfunctions. RESULTS: For the offspring of schizophrenic parents, childhood deficits in verbal memory, gross motor skills, and attention identified 83\%, 75\%, and 58\%, respectively, of the subjects with schizophrenia-related psychoses; 50\% were identified by all three variables combined. False positive rates in subjects who did not develop schizophrenia-related psychoses ranged from 18\% for those with deficits in attention during childhood to 28\% for those with deficits in memory. The three variables had low deficit rates in the offspring of the other two parental groups and were not associated with other psychiatric disorders in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia-related psychoses in adulthood are distinguished in subjects at risk for schizophrenia by childhood deficits in verbal memory, gross motor skills, and attention. The findings suggest that deficits in these variables are relatively specific to schizophrenia risk and may be indicators of the genetic liability to schizophrenia.},

Early motor developmental milestones, such as learning to walk, are predictors of later schizophrenia but studies have not been systematically reviewed. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the association between early motor developmental milestones and the risk of adult schizophrenia. In addition, we updated a systematic review on motor function and risk of schizophrenia. The PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus databases were searched for original research articles published up to July 2015. Motor milestones were measured between ages 0 and 13years. Random effect meta-analysis calculated effect estimates (Hedges' g) for the association between individual motor milestones and schizophrenia risk. An electronic database and selected articles reference list search identified 5990 articles after removing duplicates. Sixty-nine full text articles were assessed for eligibility of which six were included in the review. Five studies provided sufficient data for meta-analyses. The following motor milestones were significantly associated with adult schizophrenia risk: walking unsupported (g=0.46; 95\% CI 0.27–0.64; p{\textless}0.001), standing unsupported (g=0.28; 0.16–0.40; p{\textless}0.001) and sitting unsupported (g=0.18; 0.05–0.31; p=0.007). Results for the milestones ‘holding head up’ and ‘grabbing object’ were not statistically significant. Delayed walking, sitting and standing unsupported were associated with adult onset schizophrenia. The findings emphasise the importance of timely achievement of these motor milestones in childhood and can contribute to the identification of individuals at risk of psychosis.},

	abstract = {Background
Altered motor behavior has consistently been reported in medication-naive adult patients with schizophrenia and first episode psychosis and adults at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). This study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of abnormal involuntary movements in a community sample of children and adolescents with and without CHR.
Methods
We examined CHR in 102 children and adolescents aged 8–17years from the general population of the Canton Bern. Attenuated and brief intermittent psychotic symptoms, as well as basic symptoms, were assessed using the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes and the Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument, Child \& Youth Version. Motor symptoms were assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Additionally, psychosocial functioning, a neurocognitive test battery, and DSM-IV Axis I disorders were examined.
Results
Eleven (10.8\%) participants met CHR criteria, 13 (12.7\%, 5 with and 8 without CHR) met criteria for increased abnormal involuntary movements (AIMS≥2). Both AIMS total scores and the percentage of children with AIMS≥2 were significantly higher in the CHR group. Psychosocial functioning was reduced in subjects with abnormal involuntary movements, and movement abnormalities were linked to deficits in attention and perception but not to the presence of non-psychotic mental disorders.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that abnormal involuntary movements are linked to psychosis risk in children and adolescents from the general population. Thus, abnormal involuntary movements might represent an additional useful and easily accessible predictor of psychosis.},

	abstract = {Neuromotor dysfunction is a consistent finding in high-risk and archival studies of schizophrenia, but the sources of this dysfunction and its role in the developmental course of the disorder remain poorly understood. This study examined childhood motor predictors of adult psychiatric outcome in a birth cohort sample (72 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 63 unaffected siblings, and 7,941 nonpsychiatric controls), evaluated prospectively with neurologic examinations at 8 months, 4 years, and 7 years of age. Deviance on motor coordination measures at 7 years was associated with both adult schizophrenia and unaffected sibling status, suggesting that a cofamilial (and perhaps genetic) factor underlies motor coordination deficits in schizophrenia. Unusual movements at ages 4 and 7 predicted adult schizophrenia but not unaffected sibling status, indicating that these deficits may be specific to those who will develop the clinical phenotype. None of the motor precursors were confined to patients with an early age at first treatment contact. Fetal hypoxia predicted unusual movements at 4 but not 7 years among the preschizophrenia subjects, suggesting neurodevelopmental dependence of its functional effects. Neither prenatal complications nor birth weight were associated with motor dysfunction in preschizophrenia subjects or their unaffected siblings at any age. Finally, preschizophrenia children did not show the expected developmental decline in unusual movements, perhaps reflecting aberrant functional maturation of cortical-subcortical pathways.},

Method: A standardized childhood neurological examination was administered to a sample of 265 Danish children in 1972, when participants were 10–13 years old. Adult diagnostic information was available for 244 members of the sample. Participants fell into three groups: children whose mothers or fathers had a psychiatric hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia (N=94); children who had at least one parent with a psychiatric record of hospitalization for a nonpsychotic disorder (N=84); and children with no parental records of psychiatric hospitalization (N=66). Psychiatric outcomes of the offspring were assessed through psychiatric interviews in 1992 when participants were 31–33 years of age, as well as through a scan of national psychiatric registers completed in May 2007. Results: Children who later developed a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (N=32) displayed significantly higher scores on a scale of coordination deficits compared with those who did not develop a mental illness in this category (N=133). Conclusions: Results from this study provide further support for the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and underscore the potential role of cerebellar and/or basal ganglia abnormalities in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Background
Evidence suggests that prenatal insult may play a role in the etiology of psychotic disorders. Minor physical anomalies (MPA) are an indicator of abnormal fetal development and are elevated in individuals at genetic and behavioral risk for psychosis. Yet, there has been little empirical research on the relationships between MPAs and other neurobiological risk indicators. We hypothesized that the frequency of MPAs (an external marker of prenatal central nervous system [CNS] disruption) would be associated with two other biomarkers suggestive of disruptions in fetal neurodevelopment: movement abnormalities (an indicator of striatal abnormalities) and heightened cortisol secretion (an indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA]/hippocampal function).
Methods
Participants with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD; n = 39) and both normal (n = 47) and other personality disorders (n = 28) control subjects were administered structured diagnostic interviews and assessed for MPAs, movement abnormalities, and salivary cortisol.
Results
Schizotypal personality disorder participants showed significantly greater MPAs and movement abnormalities and higher cortisol than both the normal and other personality disorders groups. Hierarchal linear regression analyses revealed that higher rates of MPAs were linked with greater movement abnormalities and salivary cortisol.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that MPAs serve as a marker of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that affect striatal and hippocampal regions.},

At baseline, movement abnormalities were positively correlated with the severity of positive, negative, and total prodromal symptoms.

Further, the schizotypal personality disorder group alone showed significant increases in movement abnormalities over time. Movement abnormalities were correlated with prodromal symptoms at each time period, and for several body regions, the magnitude of this relationship significantly increased over time.The results are consistent with the hypothesis of shared neural circuitry for movement abnormalities and psychotic symptoms and suggest the potential value of including an assessment of motor signs in screening for psychosis risk.Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2008;65(2):165-171--{\textgreater}},

Movement abnormalities and cognitive deficits may represent external markers of an underlying neural process linked with the early etiology of psychosis. As basal ganglia function plays a governing role in both movement and cognitive processes, an understanding of the relationship between these phenomena stands to inform etiologic conceptualizations of vulnerability and psychotic disorders.
Methods
In this investigation, trained raters coded movement abnormalities in videotapes from structured interviews of adolescents and young adults with a prodromal risk syndrome (n = 90). The participants were administered a neuropsychological battery including measures of verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, immediate/delayed auditory memory, and an estimate of full-scale intelligence quotient. Diagnostic status was followed for a 2-year period utilizing structured clinical interviews, during which time 24 high-risk participants (26.66\%) converted to an Axis I psychotic disorder.
Results
Elevated dyskinetic movements in the upper-body region were correlated with deficits in domains of verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and both immediate and delayed auditory memory. Further, discriminant function analyses indicated that baseline movement abnormalities and neurocognitive deficits significantly classified those high-risk participants who would eventually convert to a psychotic disorder (72.3\%).
Conclusions
Results support a common cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuit irregularity, underlying both movement abnormalities and cognitive deficits in individuals at high risk for psychosis. Models incorporating external markers of progressive basal ganglia dysfunction may enhance detection and preventive intervention for those high-risk individuals most in need of treatment.},

	abstract = {Kendler contrasted early and more modern depictions of schizophrenia and observed that while abnormal motor behaviors were prominently featured in the diagnostic conceptions in the first half of the 20th century, these signs are all but entirely neglected in more modern operationalized systems.1 This change was likely due to the mid-century advent of antipsychotic medication when characteristic motor side effects began to mask “spontaneous” movement abnormalities and investigators and clinicians turned to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia instead. As a result, motor pathology vanished as a core feature of psychosis for more than 50 years. However, a new generation of research, focusing on biological relatives, medication-naïve patients, and prospective high-risk research designs has renewed the mechanistic focus on motor function.2 Dovetailing these advancements is accumulating evidence which suggests that although some motor abnormalities may prove to be unique to psychosis, that movement phenomena can be highly relevant even if they are not specific to a particular disorder.3–5 For example, the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) has just now released a sixth domain devoted to motor symptoms: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-18-053.html. Further, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) assigned a separate diagnostic category for catatonia and emphasized association with multiple disorders. However, while mechanistic and dimensional understanding of motor behaviors has received increased attention, a focus on relevant clinical considerations has been lacking. This is unfortunate as motor phenomena have significant intervention as well as unique clinical research implications that are not addressed in other domains of psychopathology. This list ranges widely from the direct treatment of motor symptoms such as catatonia and minimization of motor medication side effects to the broader applications of driving prediction, precision medicine and highlighting novel treatment target mechanisms as well.},

Partitioning individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) using motor behavior may provide a novel perspective on different etiological pathways or patient subtypes. A k-means cluster analysis was conducted in CHR (N = 69; 42\% female, mean age = 18.67 years) young adults using theoretically distinct measures of motor behavior. The resulting subtypes were then compared on positive and negative symptoms at baseline, and 2-year risk of psychosis conversion. CHR participants were followed for 2 years to determine conversion to psychosis. CHR subtypes and healthy controls (n = 61; 57\% female, mean age = 18.58 years) were compared on multiple cognitive domains and cortical-striatal connectivity. Results suggest 3 vulnerability subtypes of CHR individuals with different profiles of motor performance, symptoms, risk for conversion to psychosis, cognition, and thalamocortical connectivity. This approach may reflect a novel strategy for promoting tailored risk assessment as well as future research developing individualized medicine.},

A body of work has sought to identify homogenous negative symptom subgroups—a strategy that can promote mechanistic understanding and precision medicine. However, our knowledge of negative symptom subgroups among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis is limited. Here, we investigated distinct negative symptom profiles in a large CHR sample (N = 244) using a cluster analysis approach. Subgroups were compared on external validators that are (1) commonly observed in the schizophrenia literature and/or (2) may be particularly relevant for CHR individuals, informing early prevention and prediction. We observed 4 distinct negative symptom subgroups, including individuals with (1) lower symptom severity, (2) deficits in emotion, (3) impairments in volition, and (4) global elevations. Analyses of external validators suggested a pattern in which individuals with global impairments and volitional deficits exhibited more clinical pathology. Furthermore, the Volition group endorsed more disorganized, anxious, and depressive symptoms and impairments in functioning compared to the Emotion group. These data suggest there are unique negative symptom profiles in CHR individuals, converging with studies in schizophrenia indicating motivational deficits may be central to this symptom dimension. Furthermore, observed differences in CHR relevant external validators may help to inform early identification and treatment efforts.},

	abstract = {Psychomotor abnormalities have been abundantly observed in psychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCH). Although early psychopathological descriptions highlighted the truly psychomotor nature of these abnormalities, more recent investigations conceive them rather in purely motor terms. This has led to an emphasis of dopamine-based abnormalities in subcortical–cortical circuits including substantia nigra, basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex. Following recent findings in MDD, BD, and SCH, we suggest a concept of psychomotor symptoms in the literal sense of the term by highlighting three specifically psychomotor (rather than motor) mechanisms including their biochemical modulation. These include: (i) modulation of dopamine- and substantia nigra-based subcortical–cortical motor circuit by primarily non-motor subcortical raphe nucleus and serotonin via basal ganglia and thalamus (as well as by other neurotransmitters like glutamate and GABA); (ii) modulation of motor cortex and motor network by non-motor cortical networks like default-mode network and sensory networks; (iii) global activity in cortex may also shape regional distribution of neural activity in motor cortex. We demonstrate that these three psychomotor mechanisms and their underlying biochemical modulation are operative in both healthy subjects as well as in MDD, BD, and SCH subjects; the only difference consists in the fact that these mechanisms are abnormally balanced and thus manifest in extreme values in psychiatric disorders. We conclude that psychomotor mechanisms operate in a dimensional and cross-nosological way as their degrees of expression are related to levels of psychomotor activity (across different disorders) rather than to the diagnostic categories themselves. Psychomotor mechanisms and their biochemical modulation can be considered paradigmatic examples of a dimensional approach as suggested in RDoC and the recently introduced spatiotemporal psychopathology.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Disorders of speech production may be accompanied by abnormal processing of speech sensory feedback. Here, we introduce a semi-automated analysis designed to assess the degree to which speakers use natural online feedback to decrease acoustic variability in spoken words. Because production deficits in aphasia have been hypothesised to stem from problems with sensorimotor integration, we investigated whether persons with aphasia (PWA) can correct their speech acoustics online.Method: Eight PWA in the chronic stage produced 200 repetitions each of three monosyllabic words. Formant variability was measured for each vowel in multiple time windows within the syllable, and the reduction in formant variability from vowel onset to midpoint was quantified.Result: PWA significantly decreased acoustic variability over the course of the syllable, providing evidence of online feedback correction mechanisms. The magnitude of this corrective formant movement exceeded past measurements in control participants.Conclusion: Vowel centreing behaviour suggests that error correction abilities are at least partially spared in speakers with aphasia, and may be relied upon to compensate for feedforward deficits by bringing utterances back on track. These proof of concept data show the potential of this analysis technique to elucidate the mechanisms underlying disorders of speech production.},

But the properties of this child-directed speech are not static over the first months or years of a child's life. This study assesses a large cohort of children and caregivers (n = 84) at 7, 10, 18, and 24 months to document (1) how a battery of phonetic, phonological, and lexical characteristics of child-directed speech changes in the first 2 years of life and (2) how input at these different stages predicts toddlers' phonological processing and vocabulary size at 2 years. Results show that most measures of child-directed speech do change as children age, and certain characteristics, like hyperarticulation, actually peak at 24 months. For language outcomes, children's phonological processing benefited from exposure to longer (in phonemes) words, more diverse word types, and enhanced coarticulation in their input. It is proposed that longer words in the input may stimulate children's phonological working memory development, while heightened coarticulation simultaneously introduces important sublexical cues and exposes them to challenging, naturalistic speech, leading to overall stronger phonological processing outcomes.},

However, those results were partly based on measures that are fairly robust to environmental variation, e.g. the onset of babbling. By contrast, directed speech input is typically linked to lexical development, which is environmentally sensitive. We investigate whether these children’s vocal motor schemes—a motor-phonological measure of stable consonant production related to early vocabulary—show a similar “expected” developmental pattern to what has been found for typically developing children in urban “child-centered” linguistic communities. We also compare development between the two languages, whose phonological inventories differ greatly in size and complexity. Using spontaneous speech from clips sampled across children’s waking days at home, we find that children’s canonical babble and stable consonant production is overall comparable to previous work with typically developing children. We find no evidence for difference between the two languages.},

	abstract = {Purpose 

This study tested proposals that maternal verbal responses shape infant vocal development, proposals based in part on evidence that infants modified their vocalizations to match mothers' experimentally manipulated vowel or consonant–vowel responses to most (i.e., 70\%–80\%) infant vocalizations. We tested the proposal in ordinary rather than experimentally manipulated interactions.

Method 

Response-based proposals were tested in a cross-sectional study of 35 infants, ages 4 to 14 months, engaged in everyday interactions in their homes with their mothers using a standard set of toys and picture books.

Results 

Mothers responded to 30\% of infant vocalizations with vocal behaviors of their own, far fewer than experimentally manipulated response rates. Moreover, mothers produced comparatively few vowel and consonant–vowel models and responded to infants' vowel and consonant–vowel vocalizations in similar numbers. Infants showed little evidence of systematically modifying their vocal forms to match maternal responses in these interactions. Instead, consonant–vowel vocalizations increased significantly with infant age.

Conclusions 

Results obtained in ordinary interactions, rather than response manipulation, did not provide substantial support for response-based mechanisms of infant vocal development. Consistent with other research, however, consonant–vowel productions increased with infant age.},

An analysis of intonation patterns indicated there was a predominance of falling intonation contours and limited interutterance variation of fundamental frequency. Phonetic development was quite delayed, with major acquisitions in babbling showing marked delay relative to chronological age. Acquisition of the first spoken word had not occured by the age of twenty-six months.

	abstract = {Purpose
This pilot study explored the volubility, consonant singleton acquisition, and syllable structure development between infants and toddlers (birth–24 months) with typical speech sound production (TYP) and those later diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS).
Method
A retrospective longitudinal between- and within-subjects research design was utilized (TYP N=2; CAS N=4). Vocalizations from participants were analyzed between birth–24 months from home videotapes, volunteered by the children's parents, according to type (nonresonant vs. resonant), volubility, place and manner of consonant singletons, and syllable shape (V, CV, VC, CVC, VCV, CVCV, VCVC, and “Other”).
Results
Volubility between groups was not significant but statistically significant differences were found in the number of: resonant and non-resonant productions; different consonant singletons; different place features; different manner classes; and proportional use of fricative, glottal, and voiceless phones. Infants and toddlers in the CAS group also demonstrated difficulty with CVCs, had limited syllable shapes, and possible regression of vowel syllable structure.
Conclusions
Data corroborate parent reports that infants and toddlers later diagnosed with CAS present differently than do those with typical speech sound skills. Additional study with infants and toddlers later diagnosed with non-CAS speech sound disorder is needed. Learning outcomes: Readers will: (1) describe current perspectives on volubility of infants and toddlers later diagnosed with CAS; (2) describe current perspectives of the consonant singleton and syllable shape inventories of infants and toddlers later diagnosed with CAS; and (3) discuss the potential differences between the speech sound development of infants and toddlers later diagnosed with CAS and those with typical speech sound skill.},

Videos were analyzed to identify existing communicative forms and functions. Analyses were undertaken on seven children who were later diagnosed with FXS. The children were filmed when they were 9–12 months old and before being diagnosed. Fourteen different communicative forms and six different communicative functions were observed. All participants were observed to express the functions of ‘Attention to self’ and ‘Answering’, but none indicated ‘Requesting action’, ‘Requesting information’, ‘Choice making’, or ‘Imitating’. Results suggest that children with FXS may have a limited range of communicative forms and functions when they are from 9 to 12 months of age. However, further research is necessary to gain a specific developmental profile of socio-communicative forms and functions in FXS.},

	abstract = {To determine whether late onset of canonical babbling could be used as a criterion to determine risk of hearing impairment, we obtained vocalization samples longitudinally from 94 infants with normal hearing and 37 infants with severe to profound hearing impairment. Parents were instructed to report the onset of canonical babbling (the production of well-formed syllables such as "da," "na," "bee," "yaya"). Verification that the infants were producing canonical syllables was collected in laboratory audio recordings. Infants with normal hearing produced canonical vocalizations before 11 months of age (range, 3 to 10 months; mode, 7 months); infants who were deaf failed to produce canonical syllables until 11 months of age or older, often well into the third year of life (range, 11 to 49 months; mode, 24 months). The correlation between age at onset of the canonical stage and age at auditory amplification was 0.68, indicating that early identification and fitting of hearing aids is of significant benefit to infants learning language. The fact that there is no overlap in the distribution of the onset of canonical babbling between infants with normal hearing and infants with hearing impairment means that the failure of otherwise healthy infants to produce canonical syllables before 11 months of age should be considered a serious risk factor for hearing impairment and, when observed, should result in immediate referral for audiologic evaluation.

	abstract = {Objective: 
          Infants with hearing loss are known to be slower to develop spoken vocabulary than peers with normal hearing. Previous research demonstrates that they differ from normal-hearing children in several aspects of prelinguistic vocal development. Less is known about the vocalizations of early-identified infants with access to current hearing technologies. This longitudinal study documents changes in prelinguistic vocalizations in early-identified infants with varying degrees of hearing loss, compared with a group of infants with normal hearing. It was hypothesized that infants with hearing loss would demonstrate phonetic delays and that selected aspects of phonetic learning may be differentially affected by restricted auditory access.
          Design: 
          The vocalizations and early verbalizations of 21 infants with normal hearing and 12 early-identified infants with hearing loss were compared over a period of 14 mo (from 10 to 24 mo of age). Thirty-minute mother-child interaction sessions were video recorded at 6- to 8-wk intervals in a laboratory playroom setting. Syllable complexity changes and consonantal development were quantified from vocalizations and early verbalizations. Early behaviors were related to speech production measures at 36 mo of age. Participants with hearing loss were recruited from local audiology clinics and early intervention programs. Participants with normal hearing were recruited through day care centers and pediatrician offices.
          Results: 
          Relative to age-matched, normal-hearing peers, children with hearing loss were delayed in the onset of consistent canonical babble. However, certain children with moderately-severe losses babbled on time, and infants with cochlear implants babbled within 2 to 6 mo of implantation. The infants with hearing loss had smaller consonantal inventories and were slower to increase syllable shape complexity than age-matched normal-hearing peers. The overall pattern of results suggested that consonant development in infants with hearing loss was delayed but not qualitatively different from children with normal hearing. Delays appeared to be less pronounced than suggested by previous research. However, fricative/affricate development progressed slowly in infants with hearing loss and divergence from the patterns of normal-hearing children was observed. Six children (2 with normal hearing; 4 with hearing loss) were identified as atypical, based on their rates of development. At 24 mo of age, these children persisted in producing a high proportion (0.59) of vocalizations lacking consonants, which was negatively correlated with Goldman-Fristoe scores at 36 mo (r = −0.60).
          Conclusions: 
          Results suggest that early-identified children are delayed in consonant and syllable structure development, which may influence early word learning rates. Fricative/affricate development appears to be challenging for some infants with hearing loss. This may be related to the effects of sensorineural hearing loss on high-frequency information, restricted bandwidth provided by amplification, and reduced audibility in contexts of noise and reverberation. Delayed fricative use may have implications for morphological development. Atypically slow rates of change in syllable development may indicate that a child is at risk for delayed speech development.},

Once begun, their CB was less stable than that of TD Ss. Age at onset of CB for the DS Ss was correlated with their scores at 27 mo of age on the Early Social-Communication Scales.

	abstract = {Researchers frequently examine the development of the single-word lexicon in the absence of phonetic data. Yet a large body of literature demonstrates relationships between the phonetics of babble and early speech, and it is clear that production skill is essential for establishing a lexicon. This study uses longitudinal productivity criteria to establish children’s phonetic skill. Twenty children were followed from age 9 to 16 months, and their level of consistency of vocal patterns was examined in relation to their lexical production, providing a relatively largesample demonstration of phonetic/lexical relationships at the transition to language. Number of specific consonants produced consistently across the months of observation predicted referential lexical use at 16 months, whereas the transition to reference itself signaled the onset of a sharp increase in numbers of different words produced in a session. The earliest referential speakers exhibited prior consistency in the production of [p/b], which also predominated in their words. Prior use of at least two supraglottal consonants characterized the referential group. Children varied in the specific consonants they produced consistently, and these same consonants, varying according to individual child repertoire, characterized nearly all consonant-based words produced by each child in both of the final 2 months of observation. These findings are interpreted in relation to the children’s contemporaneous development of representational ability and pragmatic skill.},

	abstract = {The early relationship between children's emerging articulatory abilities and their capacity to process speech input was investigated, following recent studies with English-learning infants. Twenty-six monolingual Italian-learning infants were tested at 6 months (no consistent and stable use of consonants, or vocal motor schemes [VMS]) and at the age at which they displayed use of at least one VMS. Perceptual testing was based on lists of nonwords containing one of three categories of sounds each: produced by infant (own VMS), not yet produced but typical of that age (other VMS), or not typically produced by infants at that age (non-VMS). In addition, size of expressive lexicon at 12 months and 18 months was assessed using an Italian version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI). The results confirmed a relation between infant preverbal production and attentional response to VMS and also between age at first VMS and 12-month vocabulary. Maternal input is shown not to be a specific determinant of individual infant production preferences. A comparison between the English and Italian experimental findings shows a stronger attentional response to VMS in isolated words as compared to sentences. These results confirm the existence of an interaction between perception and production that helps to shape the way that language develops.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study tested proposals that maternal verbal responses shape infant vocal development, proposals based in part on evidence that infants modified their vocalizations to match mothers' experimentally manipulated vowel or consonant–vowel responses to most (i.e., 70\%–80\%) infant vocalizations. We tested the proposal in ordinary rather than experimentally manipulated interactions.
            
            
              Method
              Response-based proposals were tested in a cross-sectional study of 35 infants, ages 4 to 14 months, engaged in everyday interactions in their homes with their mothers using a standard set of toys and picture books.
            
            
              Results
              Mothers responded to 30\% of infant vocalizations with vocal behaviors of their own, far fewer than experimentally manipulated response rates. Moreover, mothers produced comparatively few vowel and consonant–vowel models and responded to infants' vowel and consonant–vowel vocalizations in similar numbers. Infants showed little evidence of systematically modifying their vocal forms to match maternal responses in these interactions. Instead, consonant–vowel vocalizations increased significantly with infant age.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Results obtained in ordinary interactions, rather than response manipulation, did not provide substantial support for response-based mechanisms of infant vocal development. Consistent with other research, however, consonant–vowel productions increased with infant age.},

However, studies so far varied greatly in the measurements used for the detection of canonical babbling onset or the description of infants’ phonetic capacities at one or more set time points.

Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the associations between (1) different measurements of CBO, (2) different aspects of phonetic capacity at the age of 9 months and (3) age of CBO and phonetic capacities at 9 months. A further aim (4) was to explore whether one of the measures would be suitable to predict the age of word onset (WO) in 20 healthy German-acquiring individuals. The data were derived from monthly recorded spontaneous speech samples between 0 and 18 months. It was found that the different applied prelexical measures equally well serve as valid estimators for the detection of CBO or of infants’ phonetic capacities. Further, age of CBO and phonetic capacities at 9 months were significantly associated even though the age of CBO did not reliably predict phonetic capacities. Prelexical measures and WO were not related. Reasons for no indication of a significant association are discussed.},

Recent studies indicate that late onset of canonical babbling may be a predictor of disorders. A simple screening procedure that focuses on canonical babbling was used to evaluate over 3400 infants at risk who were about 10 months of age. Among infants who showed late onset of canonical babbling, fewer than half had been previously diagnosed as having a significant medical problem that might have accounted for the delay. A follow-up study indicated that infants with delayed canonical babbling had smaller production vocabularies at 18, 24, and 30 months than did infants in the control group.

The percentage of CB was calculated from each recording, and a validated observation form was used. How accurately the children with and without CB were classified was investigated with sensitivity and specificity. The groups were compared using predictive babbling variables. Results The observation method identified children with and without CB well, with a specificity of 0.89 and sensitivity of 0.93, respectively. Children with predictive babbling measures were identified in the clinical group (specificity 0.93–0.97), and a lack of these measures indicated a risk of being in the clinical group (odds ratios {\textgreater} 10). The sensitivity was low (0.32–0.42). Conclusion Observation effectively identified a lack of CB and supported the importance of assessing babbling measures.},

Hart and Risley first reported a “30 Million Word Gap” between high-SES and low-SES children. More recent studies have challenged the size or even existence of this gap. The present study is a quantitative meta-analysis on socioeconomic differences in language input to young children, which aims to systematically integrate decades of research on this topic. We analyzed 19 studies and found a significant effect of SES on language input quantity. However, this effect was moderated by the type of language included in language quantity measures: studies that include only child-directed speech in their language measures find a large SES difference, while studies that include all speech in a child's environment find no effect of SES. These results support recent work suggesting that methodological decisions can affect researchers' estimates of the “word gap.” Overall, we find that young children from low-SES homes heard less child-directed speech than children from mid- to high-SES homes, though this difference was much smaller than Hart \& Risley's “30 Million Word Gap.” Finally, we underscore the need for more cross-cultural work on language development and the forces that may contribute to it, highlighting the opportunity for better integration of observational, experimental, and intervention-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Purpose 

This study sought to determine the feasibility of using phonetic complexity manipulations as a way to systematically assess articulatory deficits in talkers with progressive dysarthria due to Parkinson's disease (PD).

Method 

Articulatory kinematics were recorded using three-dimensional electromagnetic articulography from 15 talkers with PD (58–84 years old) and 15 healthy controls (55–80 years old) while they produced target words embedded in a carrier phrase. Majority of the talkers with PD exhibited a relatively mild dysarthria. For stimuli selection, phonetic complexity was calculated for a variety of words using the framework proposed by Kent (1992), and six words representative of low, medium, and high phonetic complexity were selected as targets. Jaw, posterior tongue, and anterior tongue kinematic measures that were used to test for phonetic complexity effects included movement speed, cumulative path distance, movement range, movement duration, and spatiotemporal variability.

Results 

Significantly smaller movements and slower movement speeds were evident in talkers with PD, predominantly for words with high phonetic complexity. The effect sizes of between-groups differences were larger for several jaw kinematic measures than those of the tongue.

Discussion and Conclusion 

Findings suggest that systematic manipulations of phonetic complexity can support the detection of articulatory deficits in talkers with PD. Phonetic complexity should therefore be leveraged for the assessment of articulatory performance in talkers with progressive dysarthria. Future work will be directed toward linking speech kinematic and auditory–perceptual measures to determine the clinical significance of the current findings.},

Accumulating research has suggested that the cerebellum helps modulate cognition and movement, domains in which UHR individuals show impairment; understanding putative markers of risk, such as structural abnormalities and behavioral correlates, is essential. In this study, participants underwent a high-resolution structural brain scan and participated in a pursuit rotor experiment. Cerebellar regions associated with movement (anterior cerebellum) and cognition (crus I) were subsequently analyzed. UHR participants showed impaired performance on the pursuit rotor task, learned at a slower rate, and showed smaller cerebellar volumes compared with control participants. Left crus I volume was significantly associated with poor rate of learning. The present results suggest that cerebellar abnormalities and their behavioral correlates (poor learning and motor control) precede the onset of psychosis.

	abstract = {Despite known deficits in postural control in patients with schizophrenia, this domain has not been investigated in youth at ultra high-risk (UHR) for psychosis. This is particularly relevant as postural control implicates dysfunction in the cerebellum-a region implicated in cognitive dysmetria conceptions of schizophrenia but poorly understood in the prodrome. Here, we extended our understanding of movement abnormalities in UHR individuals to include postural control, and have linked these deficits to both symptom severity and cerebello-cortical network connectivity. UHR and healthy control participants completed an instrumentally based balance task to quantify postural control along with a resting state brain imaging scan to investigate cerebellar networks. We also quantified positive and negative symptom severity with structured clinical interviews. The UHR group showed overall increased postural sway and decreased cerebello-cortical resting state connectivity, relative to controls. The decreased cerebello-cortical connectivity was seen across multiple networks. Postural sway was also correlated with cerebellar connectivity in this population and uniquely positively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms. Finally, symptom severity was also associated with cerebellar connectivity. Together, our results point to a potential deficit in sensory integration as an underlying contributor to the increased postural sway, and provide evidence of cerebellar abnormalities in UHR individuals. These results extend our understanding of the motor abnormalities of UHR individuals beyond striatum-based dyskinesias to include postural control and sensory integration deficits, and implicate the cerebellum as a distinct neural substrate preceding the onset of psychosis. Taken together, our results extend the cognitive dysmetria framework to UHR populations. Hum Brain Mapp 35:4064–4078, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Manually labeled data are used to train a function that takes as input a speech segment of an arbitrary length containing a voiceless stop, and outputs its VOT. The function is explicitly trained to minimize the difference between predicted and manually measured VOT; it operates on a set of acoustic feature functions designed based on spectral and temporal cues used by human VOT annotators. The algorithm is applied to initial voiceless stops from four corpora, representing different types of speech. Using several evaluation methods, the algorithm's performance is near human intertranscriber reliability, and compares favorably with previous work. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is minimally affected by training and testing on different corpora, and remains essentially constant as the amount of training data is reduced to 50-250 manually labeled examples, demonstrating the method's practical applicability to new datasets.},

However, emerging technological advances have significantly improved the ability to detect and assess motor abnormalities with objective instruments in a timely and reliable manner. Further, converging evidence has laid the groundwork for theoretically and empirically derived categorization and conceptualization. This review summarizes these advances, stressing the importance of motor abnormalities for understanding vulnerability across different stages of psychosis and introducing these innovative instrumental approaches.

	abstract = {Kendler contrasted early and more modern depictions of schizophrenia and observed that while abnormal motor behaviors were prominently featured in the diagnostic conceptions in the first half of the 20th century, these signs are all but entirely neglected in more modern operationalized systems.1 This change was likely due to the mid-century advent of antipsychotic medication when characteristic motor side effects began to mask “spontaneous” movement abnormalities and investigators and clinicians turned to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia instead. As a result, motor pathology vanished as a core feature of psychosis for more than 50 years. However, a new generation of research, focusing on biological relatives, medication-naïve patients, and prospective high-risk research designs has renewed the mechanistic focus on motor function.2 Dovetailing these advancements is accumulating evidence which suggests that although some motor abnormalities may prove to be unique to psychosis, that movement phenomena can be highly relevant even if they are not specific to a particular disorder.3–5 For example, the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) has just now released a sixth domain devoted to motor symptoms: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-18-053.html. Further, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) assigned a separate diagnostic category for catatonia and emphasized association with multiple disorders. However, while mechanistic and dimensional understanding of motor behaviors has received increased attention, a focus on relevant clinical considerations has been lacking. This is unfortunate as motor phenomena have significant intervention as well as unique clinical research implications that are not addressed in other domains of psychopathology. This list ranges widely from the direct treatment of motor symptoms such as catatonia and minimization of motor medication side effects to the broader applications of driving prediction, precision medicine and highlighting novel treatment target mechanisms as well.},

Indeed, to perceive something is to take a sensory input and make a prediction of the external source of that signal; thus, prediction is perhaps the most fundamental neural computation. Given the ubiquity of prediction, a more challenging problem is to specify the unique predictive role or capability of a particular brain structure. This question is relevant when considering recent claims that one aspect of the predictive deficits observed in psychotic disorders might be related to cerebellar dysfunction, a subcortical structure known to play a critical role in predictive sensorimotor control and perhaps higher-level cognitive function. Here, we review evidence bearing on this question. We first focus on clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging findings suggesting cerebellar involvement in psychosis and, specifically, schizophrenia. We then review a relatively novel line of research exploring whether computational models of cerebellar motor function can also account for cerebellar involvement in higher-order human cognition, and in particular, language function. We end the review by highlighting some key gaps in these literatures, limitations that currently preclude strong conclusions regarding cerebellar involvement in psychosis.},

Group comparisons revealed a higher rate of neuromotor abnormalities in the preschizophrenia children when compared to their healthy siblings, preaffective disorder subjects, the healthy siblings of patients with affective disorder, and subjects from families with no mental illness. The preschizophrenia subjects also showed poorer motor skills when compared to their healthy siblings and preaffective disorder subjects. When diagnostic group comparisons were made within age spans, the group differences were significant only in the first 2 years of life. Post hoc analyses also revealed that the preschizophrenia subjects' neuromotor abnormalities occurred primarily on the left side of the body. The abnormalities included choreoathetoid movements and posturing of the upper limbs, similar to the motor signs described in earlier reports on diagnosed schizophrenia patients. The findings are discussed in light of their implications for the developmental origins of schizophrenia.

Manually labeled data are used to train a function that takes as input a speech segment of an arbitrary length containing a voiceless stop, and outputs its VOT. The function is explicitly trained to minimize the difference between predicted and manually measured VOT; it operates on a set of acoustic feature functions designed based on spectral and temporal cues used by human VOT annotators. The algorithm is applied to initial voiceless stops from four corpora, representing different types of speech. Using several evaluation methods, the algorithm's performance is near human intertranscriber reliability, and compares favorably with previous work. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is minimally affected by training and testing on different corpora, and remains essentially constant as the amount of training data is reduced to 50–250 manually labeled examples, demonstrating the method's practical applicability to new datasets.},

	abstract = {Background
Neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia (SZ) are established and the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS) investigated such measures as endophenotypes in family-based (COGS-1) and case-control (COGS-2) studies. By requiring family participation, family-based sampling may result in samples that vary demographically and perform better on neurocognitive measures.
Methods
The Penn computerized neurocognitive battery (CNB) evaluates accuracy and speed of performance for several domains and was administered across sites in COGS-1 and COGS-2. Most tests were included in both studies. COGS-1 included 328 patients with SZ and 497 healthy comparison subjects (HCS) and COGS-2 included 1195 patients and 1009 HCS.
Results
Demographically, COGS-1 participants were younger, more educated, with more educated parents and higher estimated IQ compared to COGS-2 participants. After controlling for demographics, the two samples produced very similar performance profiles compared to their respective controls. As expected, performance was better and with smaller effect sizes compared to controls in COGS-1 relative to COGS-2. Better performance was most pronounced for spatial processing while emotion identification had large effect sizes for both accuracy and speed in both samples. Performance was positively correlated with functioning and negatively with negative and positive symptoms in both samples, but correlations were attenuated in COGS-2, especially with positive symptoms.
Conclusions
Patients ascertained through family-based design have more favorable demographics and better performance on some neurocognitive domains. Thus, studies that use case-control ascertainment may tap into populations with more severe forms of illness that are exposed to less favorable factors compared to those ascertained with family-based designs.},

Cognitive functioning of participants who later developed a psychosis was compared to that of people at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis who did not develop psychosis at follow-up and healthy controls.MethodParticipants were 41 persons at UHR for psychosis (the UHR group), of whom 17 developed psychosis between the first and second assessment. Seventeen healthy controls were included in the study. Cognitive performance was assessed at intake (T0) and again after 18 months (T1). The areas of cognitive functioning assessed include verbal memory and learning, visuospatial working memory, executive function, sustained attention and motor speed.ResultsThe transition group did not perform significantly worse at the second assessment than at the first on any of the outcome measures. The UHR group performed better on a verbal learning and memory test at T1 compared to T0. At T0, the control group scored significantly better than the UHR group and the transition group on the verbal learning and memory test and the verbal fluency test.ConclusionsThe results indicate that no cognitive deterioration occurs during the first psychotic episode.

	abstract = {Adults with schizophrenia present cognitive impairments, as do individuals at ultra-high risk for the disorder, youth with relatives with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and children with antecedents of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to determine if impairments in childhood differed depending on the definition of risk and/or on the degree of relatedness to an affected individual, and if impairments were explained by IQ. Four groups of children aged 9–12 years were studied: (1) 13 children with ≥1 first-degree or ≥2 second-degree affected relatives (high familial loading: FHxH); (2) 14 with ≥1 affected second-degree relative (lower familial loading: FHxL); (3) 32 with well-replicated antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz); and (4) 45 typically-developing (TD) children with neither a positive family history nor antecedents. Compared to TD children, both FHxH and ASz children exhibited significantly poorer verbal comprehension, scholastic achievement, and verbal working memory, while FHxH children additionally displayed significantly lower full-scale IQ, and verbal memory and executive function impairments. After adjusting statistical analyses for IQ, group differences were attenuated. Relative to TD children, FHxL children showed no significant differences in performance. The results imply that impairments in verbal comprehension, scholastic achievement, and verbal working memory may index vulnerability for schizophrenia among children with affected relatives with the disorder and among those with multiple antecedents of the disorder who have no affected relatives. More accurate identification of children at-risk for schizophrenia and the specific deficits that they present provides opportunities for interventions such as cognitive remediation that may impact the development of the illness.},

However, these reviews focused exclusively on studies of individuals with affected relatives or on population/birth cohorts, incorporated studies with estimated measures of pre-morbid intelligence, or included investigations that examined symptomatic at-risk participants or participants 18 years or older. Thus, it remains unclear whether cognitive and motor deficits constitute robust antecedents of schizophrenia. Meta-analyses were conducted on published studies that examined cognitive or motor function in youth aged 16 years or younger who later developed schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and those who did not.MethodTwenty-three studies fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) written in English; (2) prospective investigations of birth or genetic high-risk cohorts, or follow-back investigations of population samples; (3) objective measures of cognitive or motor performance at age 16 or younger; (4) results provided for individuals who did and who did not develop schizophrenia/SSD later in life; and (5) sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. Four domains of function were examined: IQ; Motor Function; General Academic Achievement; and Mathematics Achievement.ResultsMeta-analyses showed that, by age 16, individuals who subsequently developed schizophrenia/SSD displayed significant deficits in IQ (d=0.51) and motor function (d=0.56), but not in general academic achievement (d=0.25) or mathematics achievement (d=0.21). Subsidiary analysis indicated that the IQ deficit was present by age 13.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that deficits in IQ and motor performance precede the prodrome and the onset of illness.},

As a part of the multilevel assessment, 40 individuals at risk for psychosis and 42 healthy controls matched for age, sex and handedness were investigated with a fine motor function test battery and a neuropsychological test battery. Individuals at risk showed lower performances in all subtests of the fine motor function tests, predominantly in dexterity and velocity (wrist/fingers and arm/hand). In the neuropsychological test battery, individuals at risk performed less well compared to healthy controls regarding sustained attention, working memory and perseveration. The combined evaluation of the two test batteries (neuropsychological and fine motor function) separates the two groups into individuals at risk and healthy controls better than each test battery alone.

Results: UHR subjects showed significant cognitive deficits at baseline and 2 distinct profiles of cognitive change over time. On average, 50\% demonstrated improvement in social and role functioning over the follow-up period, while the other half showed either stability or decline in functioning. Functional improvement was associated with improved processing speed and visual memory, as well as improvement in clinical symptoms over the follow-up period. In contrast, patients who did not improve functionally showed stable clinical symptoms and cognitive performance over time. Conclusions: Although the degree of neurocognitive deficit at baseline in UHR patients does not predict psychosocial outcome, the course of neurocognitive change over the first 8 months of follow-up does differentiate patients with good and poor functional outcomes.},

	abstract = {There is increased need for efficient computerized methods to collect reliable data on a range of cognitive domains that can be linked to specific brain systems. Such need arises in functional neuroimaging studies, where individual differences in cognitive performance are variables of interest or serve as confounds. In genetic studies of complex behavior, which require particularly large samples, such trait measures can serve as endophenotypes. Traditional neuropsychological tests, based on clinical pathological correlations, are protracted, require extensive training in administration and scoring, and leave lengthy paper trails (double-entry for analysis). We present a computerized battery that takes an average of 1h and provides measures of accuracy and speed on 9 neurocognitive domains. They are cognitive neuroscience-based in that they have been linked experimentally to specific brain systems with functional neuroimaging studies. We describe the process of translating tasks used in functional neuroimaging to tests for assessing individual differences. Data are presented on each test with samples ranging from 139 (81 female) to 536 (311 female) of carefully screened healthy individuals ranging in age from 18 to 84. Item consistency was established with acceptable to high Cronbach alpha coefficients. Inter-item correlations were moderate to high within domain and low to nil across domains, indicating construct validity. Initial criterion validity was demonstrated by sensitivity to sex differences and the effects of age, education and parental education. These results encourage the use of this battery in studies needing an efficient assessment of major neurocognitive domains such as multi-site genetic studies and clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Measuring brain activity during functional MRI (fMRI) tasks is one of the main tools to identify brain biomarkers of disease or neural substrates associated with specific symptoms. However, identifying correct biomarkers relies on reliable measures. Recently, poor reliability was reported for task-based fMRI measures. The present study aimed to demonstrate the reliability of a finger-tapping fMRI task across two sessions in healthy participants. Thirty-one right-handed healthy participants aged 18–60 years took part in two MRI sessions 3 weeks apart during which we acquired finger-tapping task-fMRI. We examined the overlap of activations between sessions using Dice similarity coefficients, assessing their location and extent. Then, we compared amplitudes calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in three sets of regions of interest (ROIs) in the motor network: literature-based ROIs (10-mm-radius spheres centred on peaks of an activation likelihood estimation), anatomical ROIs (regions as defined in an atlas) and ROIs based on conjunction analyses (superthreshold voxels in both sessions). Finger tapping consistently activated expected regions, for example, left primary sensorimotor cortices, premotor area and right cerebellum. We found good-to-excellent overlap of activations for most contrasts (Dice coefficients: .54–.82). Across time, ICCs showed large variability in all ROI sets (.04–.91). However, ICCs in most ROIs indicated fair-to-good reliability (mean = .52). The least specific contrast consistently yielded the best reliability. Overall, the finger-tapping task showed good spatial overlap and fair reliability of amplitudes on group level. Although caution is warranted in interpreting correlations of activations with other variables, identification of activated regions in response to a task and their between-group comparisons are still valid and important modes of analysis in neuroimaging to find population tendencies and differences.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study evaluates the pattern of neuropsychological deficits and their association with clinical symptomatology and social functioning in individuals identified as ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis.
Methods
A sample of 45 UHR individuals was identified using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) from consecutive referrals to the Staglin Music Festival Center for the Assessment and Prevention of Prodromal States (CAPPS) at UCLA. Participants were administered a neurocognitive test battery, as well as measures of global (Strauss–Carpenter Outcome Scale) and social functioning (UCLA Social Attainment Survey).
Results
Participants showed significant deficits in speed of processing, verbal learning and memory, and motor speed. Poorer verbal learning and memory performance was significantly associated with poorer social functioning, and there was a trend for poorer performance on reasoning and problem solving to be associated with poorer global functioning. Verbal memory independently predicted social functioning over and above severity of negative symptoms. Cognitive deficits were not associated with severity of clinical symptomatology.
Conclusions
Despite the absence of fully psychotic symptoms, UHR individuals experience significant cognitive deficits, particularly on tasks requiring speeded information-processing and efficient recall from memory, and these deficits appear to be associated with functional disability in a manner parallel to that observed in patients with established psychotic illness.},

	abstract = {The performance of a diagnostic test in the case of a binary predictor can be evaluated using the measures of sensitivity and specificity. However, in many instances, we encounter predictors that are measured on a continuous or ordinal scale. In such cases, it is desirable to assess performance of a diagnostic test over the range of possible cutpoints for the predictor variable. This is achieved by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that includes all the possible decision thresholds from a diagnostic test result. In this brief report, we discuss the salient features of the ROC curve, as well as discuss and interpret the area under the ROC curve, and its utility in comparing two different tests or predictor variables of interest.},

	abstract = {The limitations of diagnostic “accuracy” as a measure of decision performance require introduction of the concepts of the “sensitivity” and “specificity” of a diagnostic test. These measures and the related indices, “true positive fraction” and “false positive fraction”, are more meaningful than “accuracy”, yet do not provide a unique description of diagnostic performance because they depend on the arbitrary selection of a decision threshold. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is shown to be a simple yet complete empirical description of this decision threshold effect, indicating all possible combinations of the relative frequencies of the various kinds of correct and incorrect decisions. Practical experimental techniques for measuring ROC curves are described, and the issues of case selection and curve-fitting are discussed briefly. Possible generalizations of conventional ROC analysis to account for decision performance in complex diagnostic tasks are indicated. ROC analysis is shown to be related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making. The concepts of “average diagnostic cost” and “average net benefit” are developed and used to identify the optimal compromise among various kinds of diagnostic error. Finally, the way in which ROC analysis can be employed to optimize diagnostic strategies is suggested.},
